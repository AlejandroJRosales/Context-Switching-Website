				<p>
					Quantum Computing Theory is a field of computer science that uses the principles of quantum mechanics,
					mathematics, and computer science. By borrowing concepts from each field scientists can rigorously define both
					a broad and narrow theoretical model of a quantum computer, and later apply it to the real world. These
					theoretical models, such as the result of a quantum system manipulating subatomic particles, the theoretical
					circuits quantum computers implement to perform larger operations, and how to optimize the resource complexity
					for quantum systems, are just a few of the fundamental concepts in quantum computing theory.

						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="qubit">Qubit</p>
						A qubit, short for quantum bit, is a two-level quantum system and is a part of
						two-dimensional Hilbert space \(H_{2}\). Where Hilbert Space
						is a nondenumerable infinite complex vector space.
						We use two-dimensional Hilbert space because in quantum mechanics
						a state of an \(n\)-level system is a unit-length vector in an
						\(n\)-dimensional complex vector space \(H_{n}\), where \(H_{n}\) is the state space
						of the system. The space \(H_{2}\) comes with a fixed
						orthonormal basis states \(B=\left\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\right\}\). The vectors for
						the basis states are written in Dirac notation and are denoted as
						\(|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\) and
						\(|1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\). \(|0\rangle\) is pronounced as
						"ket 0" and \(|1\rangle\) is pronounced as "ket 1".
						</p>

						<p>
							Now, any general state of our quantum system or a single qubit can be denoted as a vector like:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle\)
						</p>

						<p>
							having unit length. This means that \(|\alpha|^{2} + |\beta|^{2}=1\).
						</p>

						<p>
							\(|\alpha|^{2}\) and
							\(|\beta|^{2}\) are probability amplitudes and
							\(\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{C}\). These amplitudes give the probabilities that when the qubit is observed
							it
							will give a state \(0\) or
							\(1\). The probability of each outcome are represented by the probabilites of \(|\alpha|^{2}\) and
							\(|\beta|^{2}\) respectively.
						</p>

						<p>
							An example of a qubit is the spin of an
							electron. The two levels of this quibit are spin up or spin down. What differs from
							a classical system is that quantum mechanics allows for the qubit to be in a
							coherent superposition of both states simultaneously.

						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="general-quantum-operator">General Quantum Operator</p>

						<p>
							Density matrix, or a density operator, is a matrix that represents a quantum state of a
							physical system. Density matrices allows for the calculation of the probabilities of the
							outcomes of any measurement performed on the system. In operator language, the quantum
							operations are represented as completely positive trace-preserving linear maps.
						</p>

						<div class="categories" style="overflow: hidden;">
							<p>Ensembles of Quantum States</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							To better understand density matrics, we should first disccus ensembles of quantum states.
							An esemble is a collection \(\mathcal{E} =
							\left\{(p_{1},|\psi_{1}\rangle),...,(p_{n},|\psi_{n}\rangle)\right\}\)
							where each \(\psi_{i}\in\mathbb{C}\), \(p_{i}\geq 0\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^{d}p_{i}=1\). What
							an ensemble \(\mathcal{E}\) refers to is the event that the quantum system is in state
							\(\psi_{1}\) with probability \(p_{1}\), or in state \(\psi_{2}\) with probability \(p_{2}\),
							and so on.
						</p>

						<p>
							Now to continue with density matrices. Density matrices are an esemble of pure states.
							In the following steps, we will (I) first define a general quantum operator \(\rho\),
							learn how and how a general
							quantum operation \(\rho\)
							functions on the input mixed quantum state, (II) how to transform
							the quantum operation into a matrix form, and (III) look at the
							resulting matrix.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>I.</b> To begin, a density operator is deinfed as:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\rho = \sum_{i=1}^{d}\lambda_{i}|\psi_{i}\rangle \langle\psi_{i}|\)
						</p>

						<p>
							where \(\rho \succeq 0\) meaning \(\lambda_{i} \geq 0\)
							and \(tr(\rho)\) means \(\sum_{i=1}^{d}p_{i}=1\).
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>II.</b> We can now define a function, so that when we pass the density
							matrices through it, they can be represented as vectors.
							This function is defined as \(vec(|x\rangle\langle y|) =
							|x\rangle |y\rangle\), where
							\(x,y \in \Sigma^{n}\) and \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and our vector
							is indexed by \(\Sigma^{\mathbb{N}}\). This function
							or mapping returns a column vector from the matrix by reading
							each entry of the matrix in rows from left to right, beginning at
							the first column and top row and ending at the last row and column.
							An example of this mapping is:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(vec\left(\begin{bmatrix}\alpha & \beta \\\gamma & \delta \end{bmatrix}\right)
							=
							\left(\begin{array}{c}\alpha\\ \beta \\\gamma \\\delta\end{array}\right)\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Next, we can use our \(vec\) function to express this quantum
							operation as a matrix through the means of equality:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(vec(\phi\left(\rho\right)) = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{k}A_{j} \otimes \overline{A_j}\right)vec(\rho)\)
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>III.</b> The resulting matrix is:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(M_{\phi} = \sum_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\otimes \overline{A_j}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Where \(\otimes\) is the tensor product of the two
							vectors \(A_{j}\) and \(\overline{A_j}\). As we can see,
							the probabilities of every state in our mixed states are
							manipulated when passed through our quantum operation.
							Through multiple quantum operations, we can
							manipulate our mixed state to return the answer we want with a certain
							probability. This type of system is similar to a probabilistic system.

							where each \(\psi_{i}\in\mathbb{C}\), \(p_{i}\geq 0\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^{d}p_{i}=1\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Now, for the case \(d=2\), the set of density matrics has the following description.
							Using the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_{i}\) and the identity, constitute a basis for the
							space of \(2 \times 2\) Hermation matrices. Thus, we can write:

					<p>
						A system that contains more than one qubit is represented in a quantum register. A system
						with two qubits is represented using a four-dimensional Hilbert space
						\(H_{4} = H_{2} \otimes H_{2}\). The orthonormal basis is
						\(\left\{|0\rangle |0\rangle, |0\rangle |1\rangle, |1\rangle |0\rangle, |1\rangle |1\rangle\ \right\}\).
						\(|0\rangle |0\rangle\) can be more succinctly written as \(|00\rangle\). The same is true for
						\(|0\rangle |1\rangle = |01\rangle\), etc. A state of this two-qubit system, a part from four-dimensional
						Hilbert space is a unit-length vector:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(c_{0}|00\rangle + c_{1}|01\rangle + c_{2}|10\rangle + c_{3}|11\rangle\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Again, as it is with a single qubit, it is required that
						\(|c_{0}|^{2} + |c_{1}|^{2} + |c_{2}|^{2} + |c_{3}|^{2} = 1\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Observations of this two-qubit system will give \(00\), \(01\), \(10\), and \(11\) with the outcomes
						\(|c_{0}|^2, |c_{1}|^2, |c_{2}|^2, |c_{3}|^2\), respectively. If we want to observe one of the
						qubits, then the standard rules of probabilities apply.
					</p>

					<p>
						It is important to note that the tensor product of these vectors does not commute. Meaning, that
						\(|0\rangle|1\rangle \neq |1\rangle|0\rangle\). Linear ordering is used to address the qubits
						individually.

							In a quantum circut, we have \(\phi\), or some quantum operation, for our gates.

					<p class="subsubsection-header" id="qtm-derivation">Deriving the Quantum Turing Machine</p>

					<p>
						First, let's take a look at each part of a Quantum Turing Machine QTM that can
						be expressed similarly to a traditional Turing Machine TM. The set of
						states \(Q\) in our QTM can be defined as \(Q = \left\{1,...,m\right\}\).
						Our tape alphabet, or the set containing the elements
						that the head of the QTM can read and write to, is defined as
						\(\Gamma = \left\{0,...,k-1\right\}\). Our tape, as stated, is assumed to be
						two-way infinite. Meaning the head can traverse the tape infinitely to the right
						and to the left, as the tape goes on forever to the left and right. Our tape is
						indexed by the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). Our head starts at index \(0\).
						Since, our set of indexes for the tape is the elements of \(\mathbb{Z}\),
						which contain the infinite set of negative integers and positive integers,
						our head can traverse the tape infinitely right and left. So, by
						defining the location of elements in our tape by the elements of the integers of the
						set \(\mathbb{Z}\), the tape can be two-way infinite.
					</p>

					<p>
						As mentioned, the transition function \(\delta\) of the QTM cannot be reformulated canonically
						to the transition function of a TM. Thus, we will start with \(\delta\) of a TM and evolve the
						transition function for the QTM. The \(\delta\) of a traditional TM can be defined as:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{L, R\right\}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						The first evolution of \(\delta\) is changing \(\left\{L, R\right\}\) to \(\left\{-1,
						+1\right\}\):
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Now that we have made the first evolution to \(\delta\) we should describe the
						assumptions for \(\delta\). The assumptions for \(\delta\) are the following.
					</p>

					<p>
						The domain for \(\delta\) is in the state \(p \in Q\) and the
						tape
						the head is reading a square from the
						tape that holds a symbol \(a \in \Gamma\). It is also the case that:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\delta(p,a)=(q, b, D)\)
					</p>

					<p>
						where \(q \in Q\), \(b \in \Gamma\), and \(D \in \left\{-1, +1\right\}\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Under these assumptions, our machine will do the following in one step.
					</p>

					<p>
						In one step, the machine will change the current state from \(p\)
						to \(q\), overwrite the current scanned tape square from the symbol
						\(a\) to \(b\), and move the tape head in the direction \(D\). Again,
						\(D=\left\{-1,+1\right\}\), where \(-1\) means the tape head moves to the
						left and \(+1\) means the tape head moves to the right.
					</p>

					<p>
						In our formal definition, the codomain for the transition function \(\delta\) of a QTM is:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Let \(\mathbb{C}\) be the set of complex numbers. \(\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C}\) there
						exists some <i>deterministic algorithm</i> that computes the real and imaginary parts of
						\(\alpha \leq 2^{-n}\) in polynomial time in \(n\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Similarly to our traditional TM, our QTM has configurations as well.
						The configurations for our QTM are comprised of the initial configuration and
						final configurations.
					</p>

					<div class="categories" style="overflow: hidden;">
						<p>Quantum States and Superpositions</p>
					</div>

					<p>
						Now before we begin any further, it is important to have an
						understanding of a few concepts in quantum mechanics.
						First is a quantum state. A quantum state is
						a probability distribution for the outcomes of each possible
						measurement on a system. There can be pure quantum states
						or mixed quantum states. In a pure quantum state, we have
						the exact information about the quantum system. However, a system can be a statistical
						ensemble of different states. Such a system's state cannot be defined unequivocally by a single state
						vector and is
						thus called a mixed quantum state. A mixed quantum state is
						represented as a density matrix.
						It is also important to understand what a quantum superposition
						is, or simply a superposition. A superposition is where
						any two or more quantum states can be
						added or superimposed together and the result will be another valid
						quantum state. (Conversely, every quantum state can be represented
						as the sum of two or more quantum states)
					</p>

					<p>
						Now, lets us continue to our derivation of a QTM. Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite complex
						linear combinations of configurations
						for our QTM \(M\) with Eucledian normal form. An <i>inner-product space</i> is a real vector
						space or a <i>complex vector space</i>. An example of a vector space is \(V\) over
						the field \(F\) together with an <i>inner-product</i>, that is a map:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\left\langle\cdot,\cdot\right\rangle\ : V \times V \rightarrow F\)
					</p>

					<p>
						The vector space for a QTM, \(S\) is a finite space of configurations that are produced from the
						combination
						of complex liner combinations where each combination is defined by the inner-product
						\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\).
					</p>

					<p>
						We call each element \(\phi \in S\) a superposition.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our QTM \(M\) defines a linear operator \(U_{M} : S \rightarrow S\), called the <i>time
							evolution operator</i> of \(M\). The <i>time evolution operator</i> of \(M\) is:
					</p>

					<p>
						If \(M\) starts in configuration \(c\) with the current state \(p\) and scanned symbol
						\(\delta\), then after one step \(M\) will be in a superposition of configurations
						\(\psi = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} c_{i}\). Each non-zero \(\alpha_{i} \) corresponds to a
						transition \(\delta(p, \sigma, \tau, q, d)\), and \(c_{i}\) is the new configuration
						that results in applying this transition to \(c\). Extending this map to all
						elements of space \(S\) through linearity gives the linear time evolution operator
						\(U_{M}\). This definition comes from "Quantum complexity theory", by Ethan Bernstein
						and Umesh Vazirani.
					</p>

					<p>
						To summarize:
					</p>

					<p>
						Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite complex linear combinations of configurations
						<br>
						Let \(\phi \in S\) be a superposition
						<br>
						Let \(\psi = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} c_{i}\), where each non-zero \(\alpha\) corresponds to a transition
						\(\delta(p, \sigma, \tau, q, d)\) and \(c_{i}\) be the new configuration
						<br>
						Let \(U_{M} : S \rightarrow S\) be a time evolution operator by extending this map \(\psi\) to all
						elements of space \(S\) through linearity
					</p>

				<p>
					\(p_{1}[x_{1}] + p_{2}[x_{2}] + ... + p_{n}[x_{n}]\)
				</p>

				<p>
					\(x_{i}\) stands for the state the system is in with probability
					\(p_{i}\). Where \(p_{i} \ge 0\) and \(p_{1} + ... + p_{n} = 1\). Our
					distribution defined above is a mixed state. Where \(x_{i}\) is a
					pure state. It is important to note that our distribution is not
					an expected value or an average of the mixed state, but rather
					represents <i>only</i> the <i>probability distribution</i> for all
					states \(x_{i}\).

				<p>
					From here on out we used will use a Hilbert space formalism
					of quantum mechanics where the representation of quantum mechanical
					systems are represented as state vectors. We use this representation
					because state vectors are mathematically simpler that the more
					general ones.
				</p>

				<p>
					The quantum mechanical description of a physical system resembles the
					probabilistic systems we mentioned earlier:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(p_{1}[x_{1}] + p_{2}[x_{2}] + ... + p_{n}[x_{n}]\)
				</p>


				<p>
					An \(n\)-level system in quantum mechanics can be shown as a unit-length vector in
					\(n\)-dimensional complex vector space. We define this state
					space with \(H_{n}\). Using ket-notation, which is a part of Dirac notation,
					we define our state space
					\(H_{n}\) as an orthonormal basis \(\left\{\left| x_{1} \right>,...,\left| x_{n}
					\right>\right\}\). We can now write any state of the quantum system as:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(\alpha_{1}\left| x_{1} \right> + \alpha_{2}\left| x_{2} \right> +
					... + \alpha_{n}\left| x_{n} \right>\)
				</p>

				<p>
					Here, \(\alpha_{i} \in \mathbb{C}\) and are called amplitudes. Finally, to meet our
					requirements defining our state space \(H_{n}\) as unit-length we say that
					\(|\alpha_{1}|^{2} + |\alpha_{2}|^{2} + ... + |\alpha_{n}|^{2} = 1\).
