				<p>
					Quantum Computational Theory combines the fields of physics, mathematics, and computer science. Borrowing
					applied and theortical concepts from each field, we can define what problems can be solved on a model of
					quantum computation using an algorithm and how efficiently they can be solved or to what degree. The reason
					this is important is because Quantum Computational Theory allows us to explore the theoretical
					possibilites of Quantum Computing and both formally and accuratley
					define what is and what is not possible in Quantum Computing.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will first start by defining the theoretical models that are unique and important to the field of
					quantum computational theory. Then, we will learn about the field of quantum complexity theory.
					Let's begin.

						<p>
							First lets be take a look at each part of a Quantum Turing Machine QTM that can
							be expressed similarily to a traditional Turing Machine TM. The set of
							states \(Q\) in our QTM can be defined as \(Q = \left\{1,...,m\right\}\).
							Our tape alphabet, or the set containing the elements
							that the head of the QTM can read and write to, is defined as
							\(\Gamma = \left\{0,...,k-1\right\}\). Our tape, as stated, is assumed to be
							two-way infinite. Meaning the head can traverse the tape infinitley to the right
							and to the left as the tape goes on forever to the left and right. Our tape is
							indexed by the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). Our head starts at index \(0\).
							Since, our set of indexes for the tape are the elemets of \(\mathbb{Z}\),
							which contains the infinite set of negative integers and positve integers,
							our head can traverse the tape infintley right and left. So, by
							defining the location of elements in our tape by the elements of the integers of the
							set \(\mathbb{Z}\), the tape can be two-way infinite.
						</p>

						<p>
							As mentioned, the transition function \(\delta\) of the QTM cannot be reformulated canonically
							to the transition function of a TM. Thus, we will start with \(\delta\) of a TM and evolve the
							transition function for the QTM. The \(\delta\) of a traditional TM can be defined as:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{L, R\right\}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							The first evolution of \(\delta\) is changing \(\left\{L, R\right\}\) to \(\left\{-1,
							+1\right\}\):
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Now that we have made the first evolution to \(\delta\) we should describe the
							assumptions for \(\delta\). The assumptions for \(\delta\) are the following.
						</p>

						<p>
							The domain for \(\delta\) is in the state \(p \in Q\) and the
							tape
							head is reading a square from the
							tape that holds a symbol \(a \in \Gamma\). It it also the case that:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta(p,a)=(q, b, D)\)
						</p>

						<p>
							where \(q \in Q\), \(b \in \Gamma\), and \(D \in \left\{-1, +1\right\}\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Under these assumptions, our machine will do the following in one step.
						</p>

						<p>
							In one step, the machine will change the current state from \(p\)
							to \(q\), overwrite the current scanned tape square from the symbol
							\(a\) to \(b\), and move the tape head in the direction \(D\). Again,
							\(D=\left\{-1,+1\right\}\), where \(-1\) means the tape head moves to the
							left and \(+1\) means the tape head moves to the right.
						</p>

						<p>
							In our formal definition, the codomain for the transition funciton \(\delta\) of a QTM is:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Lets \(\mathbb{C}\) be the set of complex numbers. \(\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C}\) there
							exists some <i>deterministic algorithm</i> that computes the real and imaginary parts of
							\(\alpha \leq 2^{-n}\) in polynomial time in \(n\).
						</p>

						<div class="categories" style="overflow: hidden;">
							<p>Inner-product Space</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							Similiarily to our traditional TM, our QTM has configurations as well.
							The configurations for our QTM is comprised of the initial configuration and
							final configurations.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite complex linear combinations of configurations
							for our QTM \(M\) with Eucledian normal form. An <i>inner-product space</i> is a real vector
							space or a <i>complex vector space</i>. An example of a vector space is \(V\) over
							the field \(F\) together with an <i>inner-product</i>, that is a map:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\left\langle\cdot,\cdot\right\rangle\ : V \times V \rightarrow F\)
						</p>

						<p>
							A QTM's vector space for S is a finite space of configurations that are produced from the
							combination
							of complex liner combinations where each combination is defined by the innner-product
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\).
						</p>

						<p>
							We call each element \(\phi \in S\) a superposition. Where each superposition is the codmain of
							linear combination of configurations for some <i>initial</i> configuration.
						</p>

						<div class="categories" style="overflow: hidden;">
							<p>Time Evolution Operator</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							Our QTM \(M\) defines a linear operator \(U_{M} : S \rightarrow S\), called the <i>time
								eveloution operator</i> of \(M\). The <i>time evolution operator</i> of \(M\) is:
						</p>

						<p>
							If \(M\) starts in configruation \(c\) with current state \(p\) and scanned symbol
							\(\delta\), then after one step \(M\) will be in superposition of configurations
							\(\psi = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} c_{i}\). Each non-zero \(\alpha_{i} \) corresponds to a
							transition \(\delta(p, \sigma, \tau, q, d)\), and \(c_{i}\) is the new configuration
							that results in applying this transition to \(c\). By extending this map to all
							elements of space \(S\) through linearity gives the linear time evolution operator
							\(U_{M}\). This defenition comes from "Quantum complexity theory", Ethan Bernstein
							and Umesh Vazirani
						</p>

						<p>
							Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite complex linear combinations of configurations
							<br>
							Let \(\phi \in S\) be a superposition
							<br>
							Let \(\psi = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} c_{i}\), where each non-zero \(\alpha\) corresponds to a transition
							\(\delta(p, \sigma, \tau, q, d)\) and \(c_{i}\) be the new configuration
							<br>
							Let \(U_{M} : S \rightarrow S\) be time evolution operator by extending this map \(\psi\) to all
							elements of space \(S\) through linearity
