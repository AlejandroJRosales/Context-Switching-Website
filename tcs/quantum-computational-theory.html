				<p>
					Quantum Computational Theory combines the fields of physics, mathematics, and computer science. Borrowing
					applied and theortical concepts from each field, we can define what problems can be solved on a model of
					quantum computation using an algorithm and how efficiently they can be solved or to what degree. The reason
					this is important is because Quantum Computational Theory allows us to explore the theoretical
					possibilites of Quantum Computing and both formally and accuratley
					define what is and what is not possible in Quantum Computing.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will first start by defining the theoretical models that are unique and important to the field of
					quantum computational theory. Then, we will learn about the field of quantum complexity theory.
					Let's begin.

							A Quantum Turing Machine (QTM) can be expressed similarily to a traditional Turing Machine
							(TM) with all components reformulated canonically, <i>except</i>,
							for the transition function \(\delta\). Below, is the formal definition for a QTM.
						</p>

						<p>Quantum Turing Machine is a 7-tuple:</p>

						<p>
							\((Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_{0}, q_{accept}, q_{reject})\)
						</p>

						<p>
							where \(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma\) are all finite sets and:
						<ul>
							<li>\(Q\) is a set of states</li>
							<li>\(\Sigma\) is an alphabet not containing the blank symbol \(\sqcup\)</li>
							<li>\(\Gamma\) is the tape alphabet, where \(\sqcup \in \Gamma\) and \(\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma\).
								The tape is assumed to be two-way infinite, with squares indexed by the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\)
							</li>
							<li>\(\delta\) is a transition function described as
								\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\)</li>
							<li>\(q_{0} \in Q\) is the initial state</li>
							<li>\(q_{accept} \in Q\) is the accept state</li>
							<li>\(q_{reject} \in Q\) is the reject state, where \(q_{reject} \neq q_{accept}\)</li>

						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="derivation-part-1">Deriving the Quantum Turing Machine</p>

						<p>
							First lets be more descriptive about each component of our theortical model of a QTM.
							\(Q\) is a set whose elements are all the states of the turing machine. Recall,
							that
							our model is an automaton, thus, we have states and transition functions. \(Q =
							\left\{1,...,m\right\}\). Our tape alphabet, or the set containing the elements
							that the head of the turing machine can read and write to, is defined as
							\(\Gamma = \left\{0,...,k-1\right\}\). Our tape, as stated, is assumed to be
							two-way infinite. Meaning the head can traverse the tape infinitley to the right
							and to the left as the tape goes on forever to the left and right. Our tape is
							indexed by the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). Our head starts at index \(0\).
							Since, our set of indexes for the tape are the elemets of \(\mathbb{Z}\),
							which contains the infinite set of negative integers and positve integers,
							our head can traverse the tape infintley right and left. So, by
							defining the location of elements in our tape by the elements of the integers of the
							set \(\mathbb{Z}\), the tape can be two-way infinite.
						</p>

						<p>
							Our first evolution of the traditional Turing machine is to the transition
							function \(\delta\):
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}\)
						</p>

						<p>You may notice this is not the exact same equation we have defined
							in the <a href="#formal-math-def">formal definition</a> of a quantum
							Turing machine, but do not worry we will get there. We first need to go
							through the evolutions necessary from a traditional Turing machine to
							a quantum turing machine necessary for a concrete understanding of a quantum
							Turing machine.
						</p>

						<p>
							The assumptions for our new \(\delta\) are the following.
						</p>

						<p>
							The domain for \(\delta\) is in the state \(p \in Q\) and the
							tape
							head is reading a square from the
							tape that holds a symbol \(a \in \Gamma\). It it also the case that:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta(p,a)=(q, b, D)\)
						</p>

						<p>
							where \(q \in Q\), \(b \in \Gamma\), and \(D \in \left\{-1, +1\right\}\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Under these assumptions, our machine will do the following in one step.
						</p>

						<p>
							In one step, the machine will change the current state from \(p\)
							to \(q\), overwrite the current scanned tape square from the symbol
							\(a\) to \(b\), and move the tape head in the direction \(D\). Again,
							\(D=\left\{-1,+1\right\}\), where \(-1\) means the tape head moves to the
							left and \(+1\) means the tape head moves to the right.
						</p>

						<p>

						</p>

						<p>
							In our formal definition, the codomain for the transition funciton \(\delta\) of a QTM is:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Lets \(\mathbb{C}\) be the set of complex numbers. \(\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C}\) there
							exists some <i>deterministic algorithm</i> that computes the real and imaginary parts of
							\(\alpha \leq 2^{-n}\) in polynomial time in \(n\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Similiarily to our classical Turing Machine, our QTM has configurations as well.
							The configurations for our QTM is comprised of the initial configuration and
							final configurations.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite complex linear combinations of configurations
							of our QTM \(M\) with Eucledian normal form. Eucledian normal forma meaning each element has a
							numeric distance between eachother. We call each element \(\phi \in S\) a superposition of
							\(M\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Now, you will notice our codomain
