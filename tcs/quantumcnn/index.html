				<p>
					A quantum convolutional neural network QCNN circuit combines two key techniques: <a
						class="sliding-link" href="#mera">multi-scale
						entanglement renormalization ansatz</a>
					MERA, which is a variational ansatz for many-body wavefunctions, and nested <a
						href="/tcs/quantumec/">quantum error correction</a>
					QEC, which detects and corrects local quantum errors without collapsing the wavefunction. We will
					explore these two components, MERA and QEC, in detail. Next, we will look at the processes that make
					up these techniques, such as quantum
						forward propagation and quantum . However, before diving into these, we need to understand the underlying
					fundamental principles of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
						href="/phys/quantummechanics/">quantum mechanics</a>, mathematics, and computer science that
					form the
					foundation of a QCNN. Let's begin!
				</p>

				<p>
					Similarly, as in other supervised quantum machine learning QML algorithms such as the <a
						href="/tcs/quantumsvm/">quantum support vector
						machine</a>, we have data from a
					training set \(T\) and a
					testing set \(S\), where \(T, S\) are subsets \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}\).
					For each training set, we assume the data is labeled by a true map \(m: T \cup S
					\rightarrow\left\{+1,
					-1\right\}\), which is not given to the algorithm. The algorithm is given training data, where
					the goal is for the algorithm to infer an approximate mappping \(\tilde{m}:
					T\rightarrow\{+1,-1\}\) for the data. After training, the algorithm is asked to apply the
					approximate mapping on a test set \(\tilde{m}: S\rightarrow\{+1,-1\}\). The approximate mapping
					needs to match the true
					map \(m(\vec{s})=\tilde{m}(\vec{s})\) with a high probability.
				</p>

				<p>
					To use quantum state space as feature
					space a mapping is constructed such that the data is non-linearly mapped to a quantum state
					\(\Phi:\vec{x}\in\Omega\rightarrow
					|\Phi(\vec{x})\rangle\langle\Phi(\vec{x})|\). Where, \(|\Phi(\vec{x})\rangle\) is a part of
					complex vector space or Hilbert Space \(\mathcal{H}\) and \(\langle\Phi(\vec{x})|\) is the
					complex conjugate
					that is a dual correspondance. We can see that the non-linear mapping \(\Phi\) takes the
					classical data \(\vec{x}\in\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}\) or \(\vec{x}\in
					T\cup S\) and reperesents it in quantum state space
					\(|\Phi(\vec{x})\rangle\langle\Phi(\vec{x})|\). In this article, we will look at the procedure
					behind quantum mapping.
				</p>

				<!-- <p>
					We will look at how <a href="/tcs/quantumcomputingtheory/">quantum computing</a> can be applied to
					classical deep learning like convolutional neural networks CNN, aptly called quantum convolutional
					neural network. These quantum-enhanced algorithms could pave the way for groundbreaking
					advancements in algorithms such as computer vision. It is known that quantum computing can improve
					the <a href="/tcs/algorithmicanalysis/">algorithmic complexity</a> of performing larger operations
					by exploiting <a href="/phys/quantummechanics/">quantum mechanics</a>. However, here we will look at
					how quantum computers can enhance the
					algorithmic complexity of classical machine learning algorithms. Utilizing quantum mechanical
					phenomena in classical machine learning algorithms like for CNN's can allow for an increased number
					or
					size of convolution kernels, and exploring larger or more complex input structures.

				<p class="section-header" id="tensor-network">Tensor Network</p>

				<p>
					Tensor networks are important to understand since MERA, a key underlying technique in QCNN, is a
					specific type of
					tensor network. Tensor networks are used to
					efficiently represent and approximate many-body quantum states by organizing tensors in a
					hierarchical, multi-scale structure. A tensor network as it relates to quantum mechanics can be used
					to represent
					complex quantum states, particularly in many-body systems, by breaking them down into simpler,
					interconnected components. They help efficiently handle high-dimensional data that arise in quantum
					systems, such as entangled states, by using tensors to encode the
					relationships between different parts of the system. In these networks, each tensor represents a
					local degree of freedom, and the network structure encodes the global state of the system. They are
					defined by a set of tensors connected through shared indices, representing interactions between
					different system parts. Tensor networks allow for efficient approximation of quantum states
					without needing to work directly with every possible outcome of large Hilbert spaces. Since, some
					of
					these states are non-sensical or are not pertinent to the states of focus.

					<p class="subsection-header" id="mps">Matrix Product State</p>

					<p>
						A matrix product state MPS in quantum mechanics is used to represent a quantum state or
						wavefunction of \(N\) particles. More formally, a MPS can
						be considered as an one-dimensional lattice \(\mathcal{L}\) such that each site
						\(s\) hosts a spin
						for each state of the site
						\(|\Psi\rangle \in H_{\mathcal{L}}=\otimes_{\mathrm{s} \in \mathcal{L}} H_s\) where \(H\)
						denotes
						complex vector space, Hilbert Space. The complexity of the state grows exponentially with
						respect to the number of spins
						\(N\). The \(H\) space dimension is \(\operatorname{dim} H_\mathcal{L}=2^N\). The quantum state
						\(|\Psi\rangle\) with \(N\) sites can be
						represented as MPS as follows:
					</p>

					<p class="math-def">
						\(|\Psi\rangle\) \(=\sum_{\{s\}} \operatorname{Tr}\left[A_1^{\left(s_1\right)}
						A_2^{\left(s_2\right)} \ldots A_N^{\left(s_N\right)}\right]\)\(\left|s_1 s_2 \ldots
						s_N\right\rangle\)
					</p>

					<p>
						such that \(A_i^{\left(s_i\right)}\) are complex, square matrices and \(s_{i}\) are \(2\)-level
						system qubits, which are elements of \(\{0, 1\}\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Let's look at an example. Consider a photon spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) chain of \(N\) particles.
					</p>

					<img src="/assets/images/1d-ising-spin-chain-model.png"
						alt="Diagram of 1-dimmensional ising spin chain." class="figure-ignore"

					</p>

					<p>
						Given the local
						basis \(|\vec{\sigma}\rangle\in \{|\uparrow\rangle,|\downarrow\rangle\}\) then a basis state
						has the
						form:
					</p>

					<p class="math-def">
						\(|\vec{\sigma}\rangle=\) \(\left|\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\cdots,\sigma_{N-1},\sigma_N\right\rangle\)
					</p>

					<p>
						There exists some generic quantum state \(|\Psi\rangle\) for the photon spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\)
						chain in this basis:
					</p>

					<p class="math-def">
						\(|\Psi\rangle=\sum_{\vec{\sigma}_n}^N C_{\vec{\sigma}_n}\left|\vec{\sigma}_n\right\rangle\)
					</p>

					<p>
						When expressed in this form, the state \(|\Psi\rangle\) is called a MPS, or
						more broadly, a
						tensor network. This representation is exact, allowing any quantum state to be written this way,
						provided the bond-dimension \(\chi\), which is the shared index between the tensors, is large
						enough.
					</p>

					<p>
						The complex, \(C_{\vec{\sigma}_n}\) tensor can is composed of rank-\(3\) tensors \(C_{\sigma_1,
						\cdots, \sigma_N}\) \(=A_{a_0, a_1}^{\sigma_1}, A_{a_1, a_2}^{\sigma_2}, \) \(\cdots,
						A_{a_{N-2},
						a_{N-1}}^{\sigma_{N-1}}, A_{a_{N-1}, a_N}^{\sigma_N}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						The contraction of matrices occurs over shared incdicies between rank-\(3\) tensors in the
						photon spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) chain. This is because these shared indicies represent
						nearest-neighbor interactions between sites or particles. Given shared indicies are summed over,
						indicies \(a_{1},a_{N}\) are trivial \(1\)D indicies, and subscript indices are dropped because
						they are implied in matrix multiplication, the generic quantum state \(|\Psi\rangle\) can be
						written as:
					</p>

					<p class="math-def">
						\(|\Psi\rangle\) \(=\sum_{\sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_N} A^{\sigma_1} A^{\sigma_2} \cdots
						A^{\sigma_{N-1}} A^{\sigma_N}\) \(\left|\sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_N\right\rangle\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Now, let's look at how we can decompose quantum states and express the state them as
						a MPS. One way to obtain a MPS representation of a quantum state is to use Schmidt decomposition
						\(N-1\) times. Note, that if the quantum circuit which prepares the many body state is given,
						than we can
						alternatively obtain a matrix product operator representation of the circuit, which we will look
						at later. Schmidt decomposition is done to
						reduce the degrees of freedom by identifying those that contain
						the most relevant information. Here, we will examine iterative reshaping of coefficient
						arrays and
						singular value decomposition SVD. Where SVD can correspond to the Schmidt decomposition for a
						properly reshaped
						array of state coefficients:
					</p>

					<p class="math-def">
						\(|\Psi\rangle\) \(=\sum_{s_1, \ldots, s_N} c^{s_1, \ldots, s_N}\left|s_1, \ldots,
						s_N\right\rangle\)
					</p>

					<p>
						depending on the chosen bipartition of the lattice. The chosen bipartition is uniquely
						determined
						in the one dimension case with:
					</p>

					<p class="math-def">
						\(c^{s_1, \ldots, s_N} \rightarrow c^{\left(s_1, \ldots, s_\ell\right)},\) \(\left(s_{\ell+1},
						\ldots,
						s_N\right)\) \(=\sum_{a_\ell} U_{a_\ell}^{\left(s_1, \ldots, s_\ell\right)} \Lambda^{a_\ell,
						a_\ell}\left(V^{\dagger}\right)_{a_\ell}^{\left(s_{\ell+1}, \ldots, s_N\right)}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						where \(\Lambda\) is a diagonal matrix containing Schmidt coefficients \(\lambda_{a_{l}}\) and
						physical indices (\(\ldots\)) refer to matrix unfolding for tensors.
					</p>

					<p>
						For a properly reshaped array of state
						coefficients for some state \(|\Psi\rangle\), given the following decomposition for rank-3
						tensors \(A_{a_\ell}^{1,\left(s_1,
						\ldots, s_\ell\right)}\) \(=U_{a_l}^{\left(s_1, \ldots, s_\ell\right)}\) and
						\(B_{a_l}^{\left(s_{\ell+1},
						\ldots, s_N\right), 1}\) \(=\left(V^{\dagger}\right)_{a_l}^{\left(s_{\ell + 1} \ldots,
						s_N\right)}\) we
						get:
					</p>

					<p class="math-def">
						\(|\Psi\rangle\) \(=\sum_{s_1, \ldots, s_N} \sum_{a_{\ell}} A_{a_{\ell}}^{1,\left(s_1, \ldots,
						s_{\ell}\right)} \Lambda^{a_\ell, a_\ell}\) \(B_{a_{\ell}}^{\left(s_{\ell+1}, \ldots,
						s_N\right),
						1}\left|s_1, \ldots, s_N\right\rangle\) \(=\sum_{a_{\ell}}
						\lambda_{a_{\ell}}|a\rangle_{a_{\ell}}|b\rangle_{a_l}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						which we can see illustrated in the figure below:

					<p class="subsection-header" id="mera">Multi-scale Entanglement
						Renormalization Ansatz</p>
					<p>
						Entanglement renormalization is a numerical technique that locally reorganizes the Hilbert space
						of a quantum
						many-body system to reduce entanglement in its wave function. It addresses computational
						challenges of real-space renormalization group RG methods, which struggle with
						the rapid growth of degrees of freedom that occur during successive transformations of RG
						transformations.
					</p>

					<p>
						The key idea is that as a result of local character of physical interactions, some relevant
						degrees of freedom in the
						system's ground state of many-body system can be decoupled from the rest by applying unitary
						transformations called disentanglers to small regions, isolating and removing these degrees of
						freedom from the system, preventing their accumulation in future descriptions.
					</p>

					<p>
						This approach enables more efficient real-space RG transformations, capable of handling large 1D
						and 2D lattice systems, even at quantum critical points. It also forms the basis for the MERA,
						a variational method for approximating many-body states. MERA is based on a class of quantum
						circuts and succesful at describing ground state at quantum criticality or topological order. A
						key property of MERA that we will focus on for QCNN is how, from a computiational perspective,
						MERA efficently optimizes its tensors based on the evalution of expected values of local
						observables.
					</p>

					<p>
						Let \(\mathcal{L}\) denote a \(D\)-dimensional lattice with \(N\) sites. Each site
						\(s_{1},...,s_{N} \in \mathcal{L}\) is a described by a Hilbert space \(\mathbb{V}\) of finite
						dimension \(d\), such that \(\mathrm{V}_{\mathcal{f}} \cong \mathrm{V}^{\otimes N}\). MERA is an
						ansatz used to describe certai pure states \(|\Psi\rangle \in \mathbb{V}_{\mathcal{L}}\) of
						lattice \(\mathcal{L}\), or of subspaces \(\mathbb{V}_U \subseteq \mathbb{V}_{\mathcal{L}}\).
					</p>

					<p>
						The MERA can be viewed in two ways: as a quantum circuit \(\mathcal{C}\), where the output wires
						correspond to the lattice sites \(\mathcal{L}\), or as a coarse-graining process that maps
						\(\mathcal{L}\) to
						increasingly coarser lattices, implementing a renormalization-group transformation. We'll
						briefly explore these interpretations, compare MERA schemes, and discuss how to use space
						symmetries.
