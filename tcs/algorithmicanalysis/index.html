					<p>What is it</p>

				</div>

				<p>
					Algorithmic analysis is used to help computer scientists understand the resources required by an algorithm for
					time, storage, and other uses. Algorithmic anlysis must analyze algorithms in a methodical, universal, and
					fair way. To do this computer scientist implement mathematical models that describe the resources used by
					algorithms.
				</p>

				<p>
					This work, although theoretical, extends beyound theory and applies mathematical models to real world
					problems. Algorithmic anlayis is apart of app development, website development, simulations, artificial
					intelligence, and anything that implements algorithms in its design. This is because computer scientist or
					programmers need to implement algorithms into applications that take minimum time and space, while still being
					reltively easy to code.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the rest of this articule we will review the mathematical models that computer scientists and programmers
					use to analyze algorithms.

					<p class="subsection-header" id="best-case-equation">Best-Case Time Complexity Equation</p>

					<div class="categories" style="overflow: hidden;">
						<p>Omega \(\Omega\)</p>
						<p>Lower-bounds</p>
					</div>

					<p>The best-case time complexity can be mathematically defined as:</p>

					<p class="math-notation">
						\(\Omega(g(n)) = \exists \, c > 0, n_{0} > 0\)
						<br>
						\(s.t. \; 0 \leq cg(n) \leq f(n)\)
						<br>
						\(\forall \, n \geq n _{0}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						I will break this down into individual parts, then piece them together to arrive at the final equation.
						First, lets start with what's left of the equal sign.
					</p>

					<p class="math-notation">
						\(\Omega(g(n)\)
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\Omega\) is Big-Omega, which denotes the best-case time complexity or the lower-bounds for an algorithm.
						\(n\) is the input for the function \(g\). \(g\) is the function that describes the original algorithm.
						Next, lets look at
					</p>

					<p class="math-notation">
						\(\exists \, c > 0, n_{0} > 0\)
					</p>

					<p>
						The \(\exists \) denotes, "there exists". So the equation states that there exists two constants, \(c\) and
						\(n_{0}\) whose values both are greater than 0. \(c\) is simply a constant that accounts for operations that
						are not proportional to the input \(n\) for \(g\). \(n_{0}\) is a theoretical size for the input \(n\)
						wherein only after input size does \(\Omega\) actually maintain the lower-bound for \(g\). Remember, we do
						not give actual values for the variables, but leave them ambigious so that we have a lower-bound model to
						use for all algorithms.
					</p>

					<p class="math-notation">
						\(0 \leq cg(n) \leq f(n)\)
					</p>

					<p>
						\(0 \leq cg(n) \leq f(n)\) states that our lower bounds, \(g(n)\) times some constant \(c\) lies between
						\(0\) and our original function \(f(n)\). This makes sense as the lower-bound runtime for our algorithm
						cannot be less than 0 but also needs to be lower than or equal to the runtime of our original function.
						Otherwise it would not be much of a lower bound. Then there is \(0 \leq cg(n) \leq f(n)\). This means that
						\(cg(n)\) lies between \(0\) and \(f(n)\). In this instance, \(f(n)\) is the original asymptotic function,
						the one that is derived from the algorithm itself. \(cg(n)\) denotes the lower-bounds of our original
						asymptotic function times some constant \(c\). Thus, this is saying that the lower-bounds of the original
						asymptotic function for our algorithm lies at or below the original asymptotic function or at or above
						\(0\).
					</p>

					<p class="math-notation">
						\(\exists \, c > 0, n_{0} > 0\)
						<br>
						\(s.t. \; 0 \leq cg(n) \leq f(n)\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Now, to put the last two parts together. This segment of the equation is saying that the lower-bounds of our
						original function \(g(n)\) times some constant \(c\) that is greater than 0, lies at or below the original
						function \(f(n)\) or at or above \(0\).
					</p>

					<p>
						So looking at the final equation again:
					</p>
					<p class="math-notation">
						\(\Omega(g(n)) = \exists \, c > 0, n_{0} > 0\)
						<br>
						\(s.t. \; 0 \leq cg(n) \leq f(n)\)
						<br>
						\(\forall \, n \geq n _{0}\)
					</p>
					<p>
						This translates to, "There exists some contant \(c\) greater than \(0\) and some constant \(n_{0}\) such
						that \(cg(n)\) is greater than or equal to \(0\) and less than or equal to \(f(n)\) where all \(n\) are
						greater than or equal to \(n_{0}\)". From what we have learned we can say that this equation here says that
						there exists a constant \(c\) and \(n\), \(c\) being runtime constants, that are greater than \(0\) such
						that our lower-bound exists between \(0\) and the original asymptotic function.

				</div>

				<p>
					So we know that best case of time-complexity is when an algorithm runs is the least amount of time it could
					theoretically operate in. So, it follows that the worst-case time-complexity is the worst time an algorith
					could theoretically operate in. Now, what is an example of this. Lets take our previous example of insertion
					sort. Now, recall, that the <i>type</i> of input for the algorithm can affect its time complexity. So, I want
					you to take a moment to come up with an example.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lets continue. An example for which the time complexity is worse is when all of the input data is sorted in
					descending order.
