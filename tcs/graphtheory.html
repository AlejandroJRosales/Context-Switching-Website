      <p class="how-to-read">This page is broken into mutiple sections. The sections are given in the contents above. There are subsections of those sections. Understanding the depth of analysis of each section can be determined by the following "algorithm":
        
        (A) Beggining of Section &lt;- Intro
        (B) Subsection of A &lt;- Continuation of A so more in depth
        (C) Subsection of B &lt;- Continuation of B so more in depth
        ... 
        (A\(_{n}\)) Subsection of A\(_{n-1}\) &lt;- Continuation of A\(_{n-1}\) and most in depth

						First, lets discuss what is meant by a graph; a visual we should have in mind. The reason being because sometimes what people have in mind when they hear, "graphs" what comes to mind are bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, etc. However, when refering to graphs in much of computer science and math what is meant really are a set of vertices connected by edges. Vertices can be called nodes or points and edges can be referred also as arcs or lines. A simple undirected graph is shown below.

					<p>
						As you can see the fundemental components of the graph are circles, called nodes, and the lines, refered to as edges. It is important to note that the choice for the nodes to be circles and the lines to be edges are not limited to such. The nodes can be traingles and the edges can he double lines. Most often though a graph is displayed as what is seen above.

						An undirected graph is a triple \((V, E, \psi)\). \(V\) and \(E\) are finite sets. \(\psi\) or Psi is described in set builder notation as \(E \rightarrow \left\{ X \,\subseteq V : |X| = 2 \right\}\)</h5>. To understand what \(\psi\) is describing it is important to understand set notation. We will not go over the basics of set notation in the web page as there are many online websites that can teach that. Here is one I like if you need help finding one: <a href="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/set-notation">https://www.storyofmathematics.com/set-notation</a>. \(\psi\) here, as mentioned prior, is set builder notation which is another thing that is important to understand. Set builder notation describes a set by mentioning the elements of a set one by one, or enumerating a sets elements in mathematical notation. Basically, we are listing out all of the elements of a set one by one but rather than doing it "manually" and writing them all out, we are using mathematical notation to list them. A much shorter and cleaner way of doing it. In the description of a set, \(\psi\) is our set builder notation.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            Our expression \(E \rightarrow \left\{ X \,\subseteq V : |X| = 2 \right\}\) can be read as, "E means the set of all X as a subset of V such that the cardnaility of each element X is 2". More watered down, what this is saying is that the set E or edges of the graph is a part of the set V, vertices, such that the number of elements for each X in E is 2. So basically a pair of circles/edges, in a graph are connected by an edge. This type of graph is called a simple undirected graph.

						The graph we first looked at is actually an undirected graph. An undirected graph has nodes and edges that are connected together, since graphs are described as such, and most importantly are bidirectional. Bidrectional, as the name implies, that the edge's direction can go two ways. For example take the following graph:
