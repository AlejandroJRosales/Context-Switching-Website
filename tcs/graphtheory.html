						First, let's discuss what is meant by a graph; a visual we should have in mind. The reason is that
						sometimes
						what people have in mind when they hear, "graphs" comes to mind are bar graphs, pie charts, histograms,
						etc.
						However, when referring to graphs in much of computer science and math what is meant really are a set of
						vertices connected by edges. Vertices can be called nodes or points and edges can be referred also as arcs
						or lines. A simple undirected graph is shown below.
					</p>
					<img src="/assets/images/simple-undirected-graph.JPG" alt="Simple Undirected Graph" class="figure">
					<p>
						As you can see the fundamental components of the graph are circles, called nodes, and the lines, referred
						to
						as edges. It is important to note that the choice for the nodes to be circles and the lines to edge are
						not
						limited to such. The nodes can be triangles and the edges can he double lines. Most often though a graph
						is
						displayed as what is seen above.

					</div>

					<p>
						A simple <i>undirected</i> graph is a triple \((V, E, \psi)\). \(V\) and \(E\) are finite sets. \(\psi\)
						or
						Psi is described in set builder notation as \(E \rightarrow \left\{ X \,\subseteq V : |X| = 2 \right\}\)
						</h5>. To understand what \(\psi\) is describing it is important to understand set notation. We will not
						go
						over the basics of set notation on the web page as there are many online websites that can teach that.
						Here
						is one I like if you need help finding one: <a
							href="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/set-notation">https://www.storyofmathematics.com/set-notation</a>.
						\(\psi\) here, as mentioned prior, is set-builder notation which is another thing that is important to
						understand. Set builder notation describes a set by mentioning the elements of a set one by one, or
						enumerating a set of elements in mathematical notation. Basically, we are listing out all of the elements
						of
						a set one by one but rather than doing it "manually" and writing them all out, we are using mathematical
						notation to list them. A much shorter and cleaner way of doing it. In the description of a set, \(\psi\)
						is
						our set builder notation.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our expression \(E \rightarrow \left\{ X \,\subseteq V : |X| = 2 \right\}\) can be read as, "E means the
						set
						of all X as a subset of V such that the cardinality of each element X is 2". More watered down, what this
						is
						saying is that the relation function between the set of vertices and edges in a graph is described as an
						edge with two endpoints that come from the vertice set. So basically a pair of circles/edges, in a graph
						are
						connected by an edge. This type of graph is called a simple undirected graph.
					</p>

					<p>
						The reason I introduced the simple undirected graph is because it allows us to get familiar with the
						mathematical notation that we will build upon and is one of the most common type of graphs

						\(G = (V, E)\)
						<br>
						\(V\) is a set of vertices
						<br>
						\(E \subseteq \left\{(x, y)\;|\;(x, y) \in V^{2}\;and\;x \neq y\right\}\)
					</p>
					<p>
						Notice in this one the difference is that the elements in set \(E\), or the set of Edges, are tuples
						or ordered pairs not unordered pairs like with a directed graph. Why do the edges in the Edges set,
						\(E\) need to be defined as an ordered pair? Well, because since the elements in our ordered pair
						are vertices in the graph, this means
						mathematically, \((x, y) \neq (y, x)\). i.e, the order matters. Thus, in the ordered
						pair of elements or vertices,
						which vertice or element in the tuple is the head and which one is the tail matters. In an unordered
						pair, or a set, it does not matter which one is first or last, it is more so which vertices make
						up the edge. So, for an edge in in the set of
						edges \(E\) in a directedd graph, we define the collection as an ordered pair or by using a tuple.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the vertices that make up our ordered pair of edges, it does not suffice to give the rule that
						the vertices
						\(x, y \in V\) or that our vertices are elements in \(V\). This rule and the procedding rule in
						the set builder notation for \(E\) in a directed graph does not produce an ordered pair. Rather,
						we must change it to \((x, y) \in V^{2}\). Reason being is because \(V^{2}\) is equivalant as
						writing \(V \times V\), or the cartesian product between set \(V\) and set \(V\).
						The cartesian product between sets forms one set whose elements are ordered pairs of the original sets.
						The general name for raising a set to \(n\), is called an \(n\)-ary cartesian product. For example if we
						had
						some set \(X\), the \(n\)-ary cartesian product of set \(X\) would be written as \(X^{n}\).
						Another thing to note, is that raising a set to \(2\), like in our case, it is called the cartesian square.
					</p>
					<p>
						So now, with that being said,
						with our updated rule we can take an element from our set \(V^{2}\) are get an ordered pair,
						like is necessary for a directed graph. When before, with an element coming from just \(V\), we
						were simply taking one element from the set of vertices.

					</p>
					<p>
						Notice how our set \(E\), the set containing our edges, is defined similarily to the Edge set of our
						previous directed simple graph. However, this definition for the set of Edges in our graph
						allows for the two elements in our ordered pair, x and y, to be the same element from the set \(V\), our
						vertices.
						i.e, our updated definition for for our directed graph that allows for loops,
						allows for an edge to have the same start and end vertice.
