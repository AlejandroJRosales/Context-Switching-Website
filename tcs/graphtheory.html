      <p class="how-to-read">This page is broken into mutiple sections. The sections are given in the contents above. There are subsections of those sections. Understanding the depth of analysis of each section can be determined by the following "algorithm":
        
        (A) Beggining of Section &lt;- Intro
        (B) Subsection of A &lt;- Continuation of A so more in depth
        (C) Subsection of B &lt;- Continuation of B so more in depth
        ... 
        (A\(_{n}\)) Subsection of A\(_{n-1}\) &lt;- Continuation of A\(_{n-1}\) and most in depth

						First, lets discuss what is meant by a graph; a visual we should have in mind. The reason being because sometimes what people have in mind when they hear, "graphs" what comes to mind are bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, etc. However, when refering to graphs in much of computer science and math what is meant really are a set of vertices connected by edges. Vertices can be called nodes or points and edges can be referred also as arcs or lines. A simple undirected graph is shown below.
					</p>

					<p>
						As you can see the fundemental components of the graph are circles, called nodes, and the lines, refered to as edges. It is important to note that the choice for the nodes to be circles and the lines to be edges are not limited to such. The nodes can be traingles and the edges can he double lines. Most often though a graph is displayed as what is seen above.

				<div class="definition-math" id="definition-math">
          <p class="subsection-header">Mathematical</p>

						An undirected graph is a triple \((V, E, \psi)\). \(V\) and \(E\) are finite sets. \(\psi\) is an identity function described by:
					</p>

					<h5 class="math-notation">$$E \rightarrow \left\{ X \,\subseteq V : |X| = 2 \right\}$$</h5>

					<p>
						The above expression can seem daunting when one is not familiar with math symbols. I will not go into depth with the notation but rather describe what the overall expression means. (Later, however, with other math notation I will describe the different parts of the code then bring it all together in a final overaching discription). This expression is declaring that <i>all the edges</i> in set \(E\) are a subset of a <i>set</i> that <i>contains pairs of vertices</i> that are not the same vertice and are apart of set \(V\). Basically, it is saying that an edge connects two nodes that are not the same node. This type of graph is called a undirected simple graph.
					</p>

					<p>
						A term that allows for multiple edges for a graph, in a more general sense, is desrcibed as a ordered triple \(G\,=\,(V, E, \Phi)\). This expression is comprised of:
					</p>

					<h5 class="math-notation">\(V\) a set of vertices<br><br>\(E\) a set of edges<br><br>\(\Phi:\, E\, \rightarrow\, \left\{\left\{x, y\right\}\, |\, x, y \in V\, and\, x \neq y\right\}\)</h5>

					<p>
						As you can see this expression looks relatively similar to the last one. We have nodes and edges. This time however \(E\) is disjoint from \(V\) and we have \(\Phi\). This sign for graph purposes is called an incedence function. This function is what connects each edge of the graph with an unordered pair of vertices of \(G\). The reason we add \(\Phi\) is because it in a general sense of \(\Phi\) allows multiple edges like previosuly stated.

						We will now talk about a couple of different graphs that exist, more specifically ones that are commonly used.

					<p>
						The graph we first looked at is actually an undirected graph. An undirected graph has nodes and edges that are connected together, since graphs are described as such, and most importantly are bidirectional. Bidrectional, as the name implies, that the edge's direction can go two ways. For example take the following graph:
