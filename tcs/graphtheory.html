						First, let's discuss what is meant by a graph; a visual we should have in mind. The reason is that
						sometimes
						what people have in mind when they hear, "graphs" comes to mind are bar graphs, pie charts, histograms,
						etc.
						However, when referring to graphs in much of computer science and math what is meant really are a set of
						vertices connected by edges. Vertices can be called nodes or points and edges can be referred also as arcs
						or lines. A simple undirected graph is shown below.
					</p>
					<img src="/assets/images/simple-undirected-graph.JPG" alt="Simple Undirected Graph" class="figure">
					<p>
						As you can see the fundamental components of the graph are circles, called nodes, and the lines, referred
						to
						as edges. It is important to note that the choice for the nodes to be circles and the lines to edge are
						not
						limited to such. The nodes can be triangles and the edges can he double lines. Most often though a graph
						is
						displayed as what is seen above.

						\(V\) is a set of vertices
						<br>
						\(E \subseteq \left\{\left\{x, y\right\}\;|\;x, y \in V\;and\;x \neq y\right\}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						A simple undirected graph \(G\) is an ordered pair or tuple \((V, E)\) where \(V\) and \(E\) are finite
						sets.
					</p>

					<p>
						\(E \subseteq \left\{\left\{x, y\right\}\;|\;x, y \in V\;and\;x \neq y\right\}\) states that the
						elements that are apart of set of edges \(E\) are unordered pairs. Where the elemtents that
						make up our ordered pair for our edge are elements from our set \(V\). Meaning, in order to define
						an edge from \(E\), its elements or vertices must came frome set the \(V\).
						Our two elements of our edge are our head and tail vertice. These two vertices define an edge or the
						elements of \(E\).
					</p>

					<p>
						It is important to note that in our defintion that defines our edges in our simple graph, the edges
						that make up our set \(E\) are <i>unordered pairs</i> or <i>tuples.</i> This means that it does not
						matter <i>which </i> vertice is the head or tail vertice. i.e. which vertice comes first and
						which vertice comes last. Meaning we do not have a start and end vertice for our edges, and do
						not care about the direction of our vertice. Rather, all that matters is we define the vertices
						that make up our edges and that they are apart of the vertices in our graph \(V\). Unlike
						in a <i>directed</i> graph where an ordered pair defines each edge and direction of the edge matters.
					</p>

					<p>
						The reason I introduced the simple undirected graph is because it allows us to get familiar with the
						mathematical notation that we will build upon for other graphs and is one of the most common type of graphs.

						\(V\) is a set of vertices

						\(E \subseteq \left\{(x, y)\;|\;(x, y) \in V^{2}\;and\;x \neq y\right\}\)
					</p>
					<p>
						Notice in this one the difference is that the elements in set \(E\), or the set of Edges, are tuples
						or ordered pairs not unordered pairs like with a directed graph. Why do the edges in the Edges set,
						\(E\) need to be defined as an ordered pair? Well, because since the elements in our ordered pair
						are vertices in the graph, this means
						mathematically, \((x, y) \neq (y, x)\). i.e, the order matters. Thus, in the ordered
						pair of elements or vertices,
						which vertice or element in the tuple is the head and which one is the tail matters. In an unordered
						pair, or a set, it does not matter which one is first or last, it is more so which vertices make
						up the edge. So, for an edge in in the set of
						edges \(E\) in a directedd graph, we define the collection as an ordered pair or by using a tuple.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the vertices that make up our ordered pair of edges, it does not suffice to give the rule that
						the vertices
						\(x, y \in V\) or that our vertices are elements in \(V\). This rule and the procedding rule in
						the set builder notation for \(E\) in a directed graph does not produce an ordered pair. Rather,
						we must change it to \((x, y) \in V^{2}\). Reason being is because \(V^{2}\) is equivalant as
						writing \(V \times V\), or the cartesian product between set \(V\) and set \(V\).
						The cartesian product between sets forms one set whose elements are ordered pairs of the original sets.
						The general name for raising a set to \(n\), is called an \(n\)-ary cartesian product. For example,
						if we had
						some set \(X\), the \(n\)-ary cartesian product of set \(X\) would be written as \(X^{n}\).
						Another thing to note, is that raising a set to \(2\), like in our case, it is called the cartesian
						square.
					</p>
					<p>
						So now, with that being said,
						with our updated rule we can take an element from our set \(V^{2}\) are get an ordered pair,
						like is necessary for a directed graph. When before, with an element coming from just \(V\), we
						were simply taking one element from the set of vertices.

						<i>Undirected</i> simple graph permitting loops:

						\(V\) is a set of vertices
						<br>
						\(E \subseteq \left\{\left\{x, y\right\}\;|\;x, y \in V\right\}\)
					</p>
					<p>
						Notice how our set of edges \(E\) is defined similarily to the Edge set of our
						previous non-loop permitting directed simple graph \(E \subseteq \left\{(x, y)\;|\;(x, y) \in V^{2}\;and\;x
						\neq y\right\}\), however, in the definition for \(E\) in our loop permitting graph the
						vertices, \(x\) and \(y\), for each edge can be the same vertice. This is because in
						our rule for loop permitting graphs in our definition
						for \(E\) it does not have the rule \(x \neq y\).
						i.e, our updated definition for for our directed graph that allows for edges to have the same start
						and end vertice, or allows for the head and tail vertice to be the same vertice.

						Lets first start with defining what we mean by a dynamic data strucutre. A dynamic data
						structure stores data and provides operations to <i>modify</i> and <i>access</i> data.
						A graph \(G\) itself is static. For a graph is simply defined as an ordered pair of sets.
						Sets that define
						the vertices \(V\) of the graph, the set of connections between vertices or edges \(E\),
						and sometiems a transition function from one vertice to another verticce depending on the graph.
						A dynamic graph or a grpah that can be modified a dynamic graph algorithm is used.
					</p>

					<p>
						A dynamic graph algorithm is an algorithm that allows for the graph to maintain
						some property of a changing graph more efficiently than recomputating
						the graph from scratch after every change. Meaning a dynamic graph algorithm
						optimizes the time complexity for updates to the graph.
					</p>

					<p>
						It is improtant to note there are two main types of dynamic graph algorithms.
						A <i>fully dynamic</i> graph algorithm
						and a <i>partially dynamic</i> graph algoritm.
						A fully dyanmic algorithm is an algorithm that allows for both edge insertions and
						deletions of nodes. A partially dynamic algorithm is an algorithm that only allows
						for insertions of new nodes to the graph.
					</p>

					<p>
						Dynamic connectivity problem is when an undericted graph \(G\) is maintained so
						that the edges may be inserted and deleted, while connectivity queries may
						be answered efficently. There are different types of algorithms that allow
						for this to occur. They are listed below.
