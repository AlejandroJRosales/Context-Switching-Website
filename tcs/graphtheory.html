						First, let's discuss what is meant by a graph; a visual we should have in mind. The reason is that sometimes what people have in mind when they hear, "graphs" comes to mind are bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, etc. However, when referring to graphs in much of computer science and math what is meant really are a set of vertices connected by edges. Vertices can be called nodes or points and edges can be referred also as arcs or lines. A simple undirected graph is shown below.

					<p>
						As you can see the fundamental components of the graph are circles, called nodes, and the lines, referred to as edges. It is important to note that the choice for the nodes to be circles and the lines to edge are not limited to such. The nodes can be triangles and the edges can he double lines. Most often though a graph is displayed as what is seen above.

						A simple <i>undirected</i> graph is a triple \((V, E, \psi)\). \(V\) and \(E\) are finite sets. \(\psi\) or Psi is described in set builder notation as \(E \rightarrow \left\{ X \,\subseteq V : |X| = 2 \right\}\)</h5>. To understand what \(\psi\) is describing it is important to understand set notation. We will not go over the basics of set notation on the web page as there are many online websites that can teach that. Here is one I like if you need help finding one: <a href="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/set-notation">https://www.storyofmathematics.com/set-notation</a>. \(\psi\) here, as mentioned prior, is set-builder notation which is another thing that is important to understand. Set builder notation describes a set by mentioning the elements of a set one by one, or enumerating a set of elements in mathematical notation. Basically, we are listing out all of the elements of a set one by one but rather than doing it "manually" and writing them all out, we are using mathematical notation to list them. A much shorter and cleaner way of doing it. In the description of a set, \(\psi\) is our set builder notation.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            Our expression \(E \rightarrow \left\{ X \,\subseteq V : |X| = 2 \right\}\) can be read as, "E means the set of all X as a subset of V such that the cardinality of each element X is 2". More watered down, what this is saying is that the relation function between the set of vertices and edges in a graph is described as an edge with two endpoints that come from the vertice set. So basically a pair of circles/edges, in a graph are connected by an edge. This type of graph is called a simple undirected graph.

          <p>
            The reason I introduced the simple undirected graph is because it allows us to get familiar with the mathematical notation that we will build upon and is one of the most common type of graphs
