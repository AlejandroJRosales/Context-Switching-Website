					<p>Quantum Turing Machine is a 7-tuple:</p>

					</p>

						<li>\(\Gamma\) is the tape alphabet, where \(\sqcup \in \Gamma\) and \(\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma\).
							The tape is assumed to be two-way infinite, with squares indexed by the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\)
						</li>

					<p class="subsection-header" id="explanation-of-math-def">Explanation of Mathematical Model</p>

					<p>
						\(Q\) is a set whose elements are all the states of the turing machine. Recall,
						that
						our model is an automaton, thus we have states and transition functions. \(Q =
						\left\{1,...,m\right\}\). Our tape alphabet, or the set containing the elements
						that the head of the turing machine can read and write to the tape, is define as
						\(\Gamma = \left\{0,...,k-1\right\}\). Our tape, as stated, is assumed to be
						two-way infinite. Meaning the head can traverse the tape infinitley to the right
						and to the left as the tape goes on forever to the left and right. Our tape is
						indexed by the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). Our head starting index is \(0\).
						Since our set of indexes for the tape are the elemets of \(\mathbb{Z}\)
						which contains the infinite set of negative integers and positve integers,
						our head can traverse the tape infintley right and left. i.e. by
						defining our indexes olf our tape to be elements of the integers of the
						set \(\mathbb{Z}\), this <i>enables</i> the tape in our theretical model
						to be two-way infinite.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our first evolution of the traditional Turing machine is to the transition
						function \(\delta\):
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}\)
					</p>

					<p>You may notice this is not the exact same equation we have defined
						in the <a href="#formal-math-def">formal definition</a> of a quantum
						Turing machine, but do not worry we will get there. We first need to go
						through the evolutions necessary from a traditional Turing machine to
						a quantum turing machine necessary for a concrete understanding of a quantum
						Turing machine.
					</p>

					<p>
						The assumptions for our new \(\delta\) are the following.
					</p>

					<p>
						The domain for \(\delta\) is in the state \(p \in Q\) and the
						tape
						head is reading a square from the
						tape that holds a symbol \(a \in \Gamma\). It it also the case that:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\delta(p,a)=(q, b, D)\)
					</p>

					<p>
						where \(q \in Q\), \(b \in \Gamma\), and \(D \in \left\{-1, +1\right\}\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Under these assumptions, our machine will do the following in one step.
					</p>

					<p>
						In one step, the machine will change the current state from \(p\)
						to \(q\), overwrite the current scanned tape square from the symbol
						\(a\) to \(b\), and move the tape head in the direction \(D\). Again,
						\(D=\left\{-1,+1\right\}\), where \(-1\) means the tape head moves to the
						left and \(+1\) means the tape head moves to the right.
					</p>
