				<p>
					Quantum Computation Theory combines the fields of physics, mathematics, and computer science. By borrowing
					concepts from each field we can rigourously define both a broad and narrow theoretical model
					of a quantum computer. Such as how a quantum computer maniplulates subatomic particles, to the theoretical
					circuts quantum computers implment to preform larger operations, to determining what a quantum computer
					can thoerticaly solve and how classify how fast it can theoretically solve it.

						<p>Quantum States</p>
					</div>

					<p>
						Our description for Quantum Information is where mixed states are represented as density matrices
						and operations are represented completley positive trace-preserving linear maps. Our classical simulation of
						quantum computations can
						be better understood by representing quantum operations as matrices.
						In the following steps, we will learn how (I) a general
						quantum operation
						functions on the input mixed quantum state, (II) how to transform
						the quantum operation into a matrix form, and (III) look at the
						resulting matrix.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>I.</b> To begin, a general quantum operation \(\phi\) is defined as:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\phi\left(\rho\right) = \sum_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\rho A_j^*\)
					</p>

					<p>
						where \(\rho\) is a density matrix describing a mixed state. This quantum operation
						is define in Kraus form.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>II.</b> We now need to define a function, that when we pass the density
						matrices through it, they can be represented as vectors.
						This function is defined as \(vec(|x\rangle\langle y|) =
						|x\rangle |y\rangle\), where
						\(x,y \in \Sigma^{n}\) and \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and our vector
						is indexed by \(\Sigma^{\mathbb{N}}\). This function
						or mapping returns a column vector from the matrix by reading
						each entry of the matrix in rows from left to right, beggining at
						the top row. An example of this mapping is:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(vec\left(\begin{bmatrix}\alpha & \beta \\\gamma & \delta \end{bmatrix}\right)
						=
						\left(\begin{array}{c}\alpha\\ \beta \\\gamma \\\delta\end{array}\right)\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Next, we can use our \(vec\) function to express this quantum
						operation as a matrix through the means of an equality:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(vec(\phi\left(\rho\right)) = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{k}A_{j} \otimes \overline{A_j}\right)vec(\rho)\)
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>III.</b> The resulting matrix is:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(M_{\phi} = \sum_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\otimes \overline{A_j}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Where \(\otimes\) is the tensor product of the two
						vectors \(A_{j}\) and \(\overline{A_j}\). By applying these steps,
						we can apply a quantum operation on a mixed state and get a new
						mixed state. Through multiple quantum operations, we are able to
						manipulate our mixed state to the answer we expect with a certain
						probability. This is a probabilistic system.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div class="subsection-header-div">
					<p class="subsection-header" id="probabilistic-systems">Probabilistic Systems</p>
					<p>
						The nature for a probabilistic system is that we do not know for
						certain the state of the system. However, we do know the probability
						distribution of the states. Our proabilistic disribution sums up to
						1. The notation can be written as:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(p_{1}[x_{1}] + p_{2}[x_{2}] + ... + p_{n}[x_{n}]\)
					</p>

					<p>
						\(x_{i}\) stands for the state the system is in with probability
						\(p_{i}\). \(p_{i} \ge 0\) and \(p_{1} + ... + p_{n} = 1\). Our
						disribution defined above is a mixed state. Where \(x_{i}\) is a
						pure state. It is important to note that our disribution is not
						an expected value or average of the mixed state, but is
						<i>only</i> the <i>probability disribution</i> for all states
						\(x_{i}\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Above and from here on out we used will use a Hilbert space formalism
						of quantum mechanics where the representation of quantum mechanical
						systems are represented as state vectors. We use this representation
						because state vectors are mathematically simpilier that the more
						general ones.

						<p>Hilbert Space Formalism</p>
					</div>

					<p>
						The quantum mechanical description of a physical system resembles the
						probabilistic systems we mentioned earlier:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(p_{1}[x_{1}] + p_{2}[x_{2}] + ... + p_{n}[x_{n}]\)
					</p>


					<p>
						An \(n\)-level system in quantum mechanics can be show as a unit-length vector in
						\(n\)-dimensional complex vector space. We define this state
						space with \(H_{n}\). Using ket-notation, which is a part of Dirac notation,
						we define our state space
						\(H_{n}\) as an orthonormal basis \(\left\{\left| x_{1} \right>,...,\left| x_{n}
						\right>\right\}\). We can now write any state of the quatnum system as:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(\alpha_{1}\left| x_{1} \right>] + p_{2}[\alpha_{2}\left| x_{2} \right>] +
						... + \alpha_{n}\left| x_{n} \right>\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Here, \(\alpha_{i} \in \mathbb{C}\) and are called amplitudes. Finally, to meet our
						requirments defining our state space \(H_{n}\) as unit-lenght we say that
						\(|\alpha_{1}|^{2} + |\alpha_{2}|^{2} + ... + |\alpha_{n}|^{2} = 1\).

						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="qtm-derivation">Deriving the Quantum Turing Machine</p>

						<p>
							First lets be take a look at each part of a Quantum Turing Machine QTM that can
							be expressed similarily to a traditional Turing Machine TM. The set of
							states \(Q\) in our QTM can be defined as \(Q = \left\{1,...,m\right\}\).
							Our tape alphabet, or the set containing the elements
							that the head of the QTM can read and write to, is defined as
							\(\Gamma = \left\{0,...,k-1\right\}\). Our tape, as stated, is assumed to be
							two-way infinite. Meaning the head can traverse the tape infinitley to the right
							and to the left as the tape goes on forever to the left and right. Our tape is
							indexed by the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). Our head starts at index \(0\).
							Since, our set of indexes for the tape are the elemets of \(\mathbb{Z}\),
							which contains the infinite set of negative integers and positve integers,
							our head can traverse the tape infintley right and left. So, by
							defining the location of elements in our tape by the elements of the integers of the
							set \(\mathbb{Z}\), the tape can be two-way infinite.
						</p>

						<p>
							As mentioned, the transition function \(\delta\) of the QTM cannot be reformulated canonically
							to the transition function of a TM. Thus, we will start with \(\delta\) of a TM and evolve the
							transition function for the QTM. The \(\delta\) of a traditional TM can be defined as:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{L, R\right\}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							The first evolution of \(\delta\) is changing \(\left\{L, R\right\}\) to \(\left\{-1,
							+1\right\}\):
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Now that we have made the first evolution to \(\delta\) we should describe the
							assumptions for \(\delta\). The assumptions for \(\delta\) are the following.
						</p>

						<p>
							The domain for \(\delta\) is in the state \(p \in Q\) and the
							tape
							head is reading a square from the
							tape that holds a symbol \(a \in \Gamma\). It it also the case that:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta(p,a)=(q, b, D)\)
						</p>

						<p>
							where \(q \in Q\), \(b \in \Gamma\), and \(D \in \left\{-1, +1\right\}\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Under these assumptions, our machine will do the following in one step.
						</p>

						<p>
							In one step, the machine will change the current state from \(p\)
							to \(q\), overwrite the current scanned tape square from the symbol
							\(a\) to \(b\), and move the tape head in the direction \(D\). Again,
							\(D=\left\{-1,+1\right\}\), where \(-1\) means the tape head moves to the
							left and \(+1\) means the tape head moves to the right.
						</p>

						<p>
							In our formal definition, the codomain for the transition funciton \(\delta\) of a QTM is:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Lets \(\mathbb{C}\) be the set of complex numbers. \(\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C}\) there
							exists some <i>deterministic algorithm</i> that computes the real and imaginary parts of
							\(\alpha \leq 2^{-n}\) in polynomial time in \(n\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Similiarily to our traditional TM, our QTM has configurations as well.
							The configurations for our QTM is comprised of the initial configuration and
							final configurations.
						</p>

						<div class="categories" style="overflow: hidden;">
							<p>Quantum States and Superpositions</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							Now before we begin any further, it is important to have an
							understanding of a few concepts in quantum mechanics.
							First is a quantuam state. A quantum state is a
							proability distribution for the outcomes of each possible
							measurement on a system. There can be pure quantum states
							or mixed quantum states. In a pure quantum state, we have
							the exact information about the quantum system. However, it is possible for a system to be a statistical
							ensemble of different states. Such a system's state cannot be defined unequivocally by single state
							vector, and is
							thus called a mixed quantum state. A mixed quantum state is
							represented as a density matix.
							It is also important to understand what a quantum superposition
							is, or simple a superposition. A superposition is where
							any two or more quantum states can be
							added or superimposed together and the result will be another valid
							quantum state. (Conversley, every quantum state can be represented
							as the sum of two or more quantum state)
						</p>

						<p>
							Now, lets contine to our derivation of a QTM. Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite complex
							linear combinations of configurations
							for our QTM \(M\) with Eucledian normal form. An <i>inner-product space</i> is a real vector
							space or a <i>complex vector space</i>. An example of a vector space is \(V\) over
							the field \(F\) together with an <i>inner-product</i>, that is a map:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\left\langle\cdot,\cdot\right\rangle\ : V \times V \rightarrow F\)
						</p>

						<p>
							A QTM's vector space for S is a finite space of configurations that are produced from the
							combination
							of complex liner combinations where each combination is defined by the innner-product
							\(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\).
						</p>

						<p>
							We call each element \(\phi \in S\) a superposition.
						</p>

						<p>
							Our QTM \(M\) defines a linear operator \(U_{M} : S \rightarrow S\), called the <i>time
								eveloution operator</i> of \(M\). The <i>time evolution operator</i> of \(M\) is:
						</p>

						<p>
							If \(M\) starts in configruation \(c\) with current state \(p\) and scanned symbol
							\(\delta\), then after one step \(M\) will be in superposition of configurations
							\(\psi = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} c_{i}\). Each non-zero \(\alpha_{i} \) corresponds to a
							transition \(\delta(p, \sigma, \tau, q, d)\), and \(c_{i}\) is the new configuration
							that results in applying this transition to \(c\). By extending this map to all
							elements of space \(S\) through linearity gives the linear time evolution operator
							\(U_{M}\). This defenition comes from "Quantum complexity theory", Ethan Bernstein
							and Umesh Vazirani
						</p>

						<p>
							To summarize this in mathemaitcal notation:
						</p>

						<p>
							Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite complex linear combinations of configurations
							<br>
							Let \(\phi \in S\) be a superposition
							<br>
							Let \(\psi = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} c_{i}\), where each non-zero \(\alpha\) corresponds to a transition
							\(\delta(p, \sigma, \tau, q, d)\) and \(c_{i}\) be the new configuration
							<br>
							Let \(U_{M} : S \rightarrow S\) be time evolution operator by extending this map \(\psi\) to all
							elements of space \(S\) through linearity
