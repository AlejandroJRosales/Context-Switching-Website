  <p class="subsubsection-header" id="qtm-derivation">Deriving the Quantum Turing Machine</p>

  <p>
    First, let's take a look at each part of a Quantum Turing Machine QTM that can
    be expressed similarly to a traditional Turing Machine TM. The set of
    states \(Q\) in our QTM can be defined as \(Q = \left\{1,...,m\right\}\).
    Our tape alphabet, or the set containing the elements
    that the head of the QTM can read and write to, is defined as
    \(\Gamma = \left\{0,...,k-1\right\}\). Our tape, as stated, is assumed to be
    two-way infinite. Meaning the head can traverse the tape infinitely to the right
    and to the left, as the tape goes on forever to the left and right. Our tape is
    indexed by the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). Our head starts at index \(0\).
    Since, our set of indexes for the tape is the elements of \(\mathbb{Z}\),
    which contain the infinite set of negative integers and positive integers,
    our head can traverse the tape infinitely right and left. So, by
    defining the location of elements in our tape by the elements of the integers of the
    set \(\mathbb{Z}\), the tape can be two-way infinite.

  <p>
    As mentioned, the transition function \(\delta\) of the QTM cannot be reformulated canonically
    to the transition function of a TM. Thus, we will start with \(\delta\) of a TM and evolve the
    transition function for the QTM. The \(\delta\) of a traditional TM can be defined as:
  </p>

  <p>
    \(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{L, R\right\}\)
  </p>

  <p>
    The first evolution of \(\delta\) is changing \(\left\{L, R\right\}\) to \(\left\{-1,
    +1\right\}\):
  </p>

  <p>
    \(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}\)
  </p>

  <p>
    Now that we have made the first evolution to \(\delta\) we should describe the
    assumptions for \(\delta\). The assumptions for \(\delta\) are the following.
  </p>

  <p>
    The domain for \(\delta\) is in the state \(p \in Q\) and the
    tape
    the head is reading a square from the
    tape that holds a symbol \(a \in \Gamma\). It is also the case that:
  </p>

  <p>
    \(\delta(p,a)=(q, b, D)\)
  </p>

  <p>
    where \(q \in Q\), \(b \in \Gamma\), and \(D \in \left\{-1, +1\right\}\).
  </p>

  <p>
    Under these assumptions, our machine will do the following in one step.
  </p>

  <p>
    In one step, the machine will change the current state from \(p\)
    to \(q\), overwrite the current scanned tape square from the symbol
    \(a\) to \(b\), and move the tape head in the direction \(D\). Again,
    \(D=\left\{-1,+1\right\}\), where \(-1\) means the tape head moves to the
    left and \(+1\) means the tape head moves to the right.
  </p>

  <p>
    In our formal definition, the codomain for the transition function \(\delta\) of a QTM is:
  </p>

  <p>
    \(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\)
  </p>

  <p>
    Let \(\mathbb{C}\) be the set of complex numbers. \(\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C}\) there
    exists some <i>deterministic algorithm</i> that computes the real and imaginary parts of
    \(\alpha \leq 2^{-n}\) in polynomial time in \(n\).
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly to our traditional TM, our QTM has configurations as well.
    The configurations for our QTM are comprised of the initial configuration and
    final configurations.

    <p>Quantum States and Superpositions</p>

  <p>
    Now before we begin any further, it is important to have an
    understanding of a few concepts in quantum mechanics.
    First is a quantum state. A quantum state is
    a probability distribution for the outcomes of each possible
    measurement on a system. There can be pure quantum states
    or mixed quantum states. In a pure quantum state, we have
    the exact information about the quantum system. However, a system can be a statistical
    ensemble of different states. Such a system's state cannot be defined unequivocally by a single state
    vector and is
    thus called a mixed quantum state. A mixed quantum state is
    represented as a density matrix.
    It is also important to understand what a quantum superposition
    is, or simply a superposition. A superposition is where
    any two or more quantum states can be
    added or superimposed together and the result will be another valid
    quantum state. (Conversely, every quantum state can be represented
    as the sum of two or more quantum states)
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, lets us continue to our derivation of a QTM. Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite
    complex
    linear combinations of configurations
    for our QTM \(M\) with Eucledian normal form. An <i>inner-product space</i> is a real vector
    space or a <i>complex vector space</i>. An example of a vector space is \(V\) over
    the field \(F\) together with an <i>inner-product</i>, that is a map:
  </p>

  <p>
    \(\left\langle\cdot,\cdot\right\rangle\ : V \times V \rightarrow F\)
  </p>

  <p>
    The vector space for a QTM, \(S\) is a finite space of configurations that are produced from the
    combination
    of complex liner combinations where each combination is defined by the inner-product
    \(\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \left\{-1, +1\right\}}\).
  </p>

  <p>
    We call each element \(\Phi \in S\) a superposition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our QTM \(M\) defines a linear operator \(U_{M} : S \rightarrow S\), called the <i>time
      evolution operator</i> of \(M\). The <i>time evolution operator</i> of \(M\) is:
  </p>

  <p>
    If \(M\) starts in configuration \(c\) with the current state \(p\) and scanned symbol
    \(\delta\), then after one step \(M\) will be in a superposition of configurations
    \(\Psi = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} c_{i}\). Each non-zero \(\alpha_{i} \) corresponds to a
    transition \(\delta(p, \sigma, \tau, q, d)\), and \(c_{i}\) is the new configuration
    that results in applying this transition to \(c\). Extending this map to all
    elements of space \(S\) through linearity gives the linear time evolution operator
    \(U_{M}\). This definition comes from "Quantum complexity theory", by Ethan Bernstein
    and Umesh Vazirani.
  </p>

  <p>
    To summarize:
  </p>

  <p>
    Let \(S\) be the inner-product space of finite complex linear combinations of configurations
    <br>
    Let \(\Phi \in S\) be a superposition
    <br>
    Let \(\Psi = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} c_{i}\), where each non-zero \(\alpha\) corresponds to a transition
    \(\delta(p, \sigma, \tau, q, d)\) and \(c_{i}\) be the new configuration
    <br>
    Let \(U_{M} : S \rightarrow S\) be a time evolution operator by extending this map \(\Psi\) to all
    elements of space \(S\) through linearity
