				We will first start with

				composition of:
			</p>

				<li>unitary transformation</li>
				<li>tensoring with a second system in a specified state</li>
				<li>reduction to a subsystem</li>

			<p>
				<b>2.</b> Tensoring a system with a second system in a specified state, or adding a system, is defined

			</p>

			<p>
				\(\rho \mapsto \rho \otimes \sigma\)
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>3.</b> The reduction to a subsystem or discard a subsystem is defined as:
			</p>

			<p>
				\(\rho_{AB} \mapsto \rho_{A} = tr_{B}(\rho_{AB})\)
			</p>

			<p>
				This operation is known as a partial trace.

			A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation where a computation is a sequence of quantum gates,
			measurements, initializations of qubits to known values, and possibly other actions. Since our quantum
			circut is comprised of these the components mentioned it is important to understand what each part does
			and how they work. First we will look at quantum logic gates.

			<p>
				In a quantum circut, we have \(\Phi\), or some quantum operation, for our gates.
				Remember, the general quantum operation \(\Phi\) as:
			</p>

			<p>
				\(\Phi\left(\rho\right) = \sum_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\rho A_j^*\)
			</p>

			<p>
				where \(\rho\) is a density matrix describing a mixed state. This quantum operation
				is defined in Kraus form.
			</p>

			<p>
				In our circut model above the incoming density matrix or mixed quantum state is defined on our left as
				\(X_{n}\). This mixed state is similar to a probability distribution for each pure state
				in that, each pure state of the mixed state has a respective amplitude that determines its
				result when observed. By manipulating the amplitudes for each pure state in the mixed state
				we can affect the outcome of the mixed state once it passes through the circuit. This outcome
				is seen on the right defined as \(Y_{n}\). It is important to note, that we only
				can describe what the final mixed state is using a probability distribution. Since we can
				only truly know what the actual final state is once it is observed. Succinctly, quantum gates
				are unitary linear transformations of the quantum state vectors.
