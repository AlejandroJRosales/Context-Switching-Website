        <p>The name Context Switching was choosen for several reasons. Lets list them, in no order of importance. Context Switching occurs in a proccesor and the brain, my two favorite things. It is the act of switching back and forth between mutliple processes really fast giving the illusion of multitasking. This is what I feel like my brain does. Swithcing between multiple subjects I am interested in really fast; switching between contexts or multitasking between categories. Now, I context switch in coversations too where I jump from topic to topic trying to teach about what I just learned. This can get annoying and confusing. So the people around me told me to get a blog. So here we are.</p>

        <p>First off, welcome to my website. My name is Alejandro Rosales and I am currently a senior Computer Science (CS) Major at Miami University, also minoring in Philosophy. My favorite subjects in CS are complexity theory, algorithms, and machine learning. Programming languages I am fluent to advanced in include Python, Java, C#, R, C++, and Lua. Also, as you can see I know HTML, CSS, and Javascript, JQuery, Ajax, and some PHP. The fields I am most knoweldgeable in are Complexity Theory, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Artificial Intelligence. In my free time I love programming. Things I program in my free time include encryption algorithms, machine learning algorithms, AI algorithms, stock trading algorithms, simulations, and now websites! I am also working on publishing a paper with a professor on a sorting algorithm I created, so hopefully I can publish and then link that soon!</p>

      <div class="tab-pane fade bg-text" id="pills-about-fun" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-about-fun-tab">
        <p>Now, I enjoy doing other things as well. My newest passion is learning about neuroscience! Before it was some quantum physics and learning about algorithmic stock trading too. I also like composing music for fun, even if it is not very good, and I sometimes play chess. I also enjoy spending time with family and friends the most! No replacing that. So yeah that's a bit about me, I hope you enjoy my website.</p>
