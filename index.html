        <p>The name Context Switching was choosen for several reasons. Lets list them, in no order of importance. Context Switching occurs in a proccesor and the brain, my two favorite things. It is the act of switching back and forth between mutliple processes really fast giving the illusion of multitasking. This happens in a processor, but this also happens in the human brain. (One of the reasons why you cant listen to TV  fully and listen to someone speak fully at the same time) But, this is what I feel like my passions/thoughts do as well. Swithcing between multiple subjects I am interested in really fast; switching between contexts or multitasking between categories. Now, since my passions and thoughts context switch, my conversations from start to end do as well. Jumping from topic to topic trying to teach and talk about about my newest passion. This can get annoying and confusing. So the people around me told me to get a blog. So here we are.</p>

      <div class="text-box">
      <p>First off, welcome to my website. My name is Alejandro Rosales and I am currently a senior Computer Science (CS) Major at Miami University, also minoring in Philosophy. Programming languages I am fluent to advanced in include Python, Java, C#, R, C++, and Lua. Also, as you can see I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Ajax, and some PHP. The fields I am most knoweldgeable in are Complexity Theory, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Artificial Intelligence. This is similar to my favorite CS subjects: complexity theory, algorithms, and AI. In my free time I love programming. Things I program in my free time include encryption algorithms, machine learning algorithms, AI algorithms, stock trading algorithms, simulations, and now websites! I am also working on publishing a paper with a professor on a sorting algorithm I created, so hopefully I can publish and then link that soon!</p>

    <div class="bgimg-3">
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>Now, I enjoy doing other things as well. I like learning new things in my free time. My newest passion is learning about neuroscience. Before that it was learning some quantum physics and algorithmic stock trading. I also like composing music for fun, even if it is not very good, and I sometimes play chess. In addition, I enjoy spending time with family and friends the most! No replacing that. So yeah that's a bit about me, I hope you enjoy my website.</p>
