					First we will introduce the idea of Hilbert Space, which was named after D.
					Hilbert. Hilbert Space is a nondenumerable infinite complex vector space. Complex space,
					being a collection of complex numbers \(\mathbb{C}\) with an added structure.
					The infinite dimensions of Hilbert Space represents a continious spectra of alternative physical 
					states. Alternative physical states, for example, being the position (coordinates) or 
					momentum of a particle. 
				</p>

				<p>
					In quantum mechanics, we represent a physical state as a state vector. This state 
					vector, again, is a part of our complex vector space.
					Following Dirac, this state vector is called a ket. 
					A ket is represented by \(\ket{\alpha}\). It is postulated that a ket contains 
					complete information about the physical state. Meaning, in theory, a ket contains 
					everything we are allowed to know about the state state. We say "allowed to know", because 
					of the limiting information we can know about a state due to the uncertaintiy principal. 
					To add two kets, we can do:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(\ket{\alpha} + \ket{\beta} = \ket{\gamma}\)
				</p>

				<p>
					the sum of two kets is \(\ket{\gamma}\), or just another ket. To multiply a ket \(\ket{\alpha}\) 
					by a complex number \(c\), we can do:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(c\ket{\alpha} = \ket{\alpha}c\)
				</p>

				<p>
					where the product is another ket. Note, the complex number \(c\) can be to the left or right 
					of the ket, it does not matter. If \(c\) is equal to zero, than the resulting ket is called 
					a null ket.
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, we will talk about operators. Observables, like momentum and spin, cab be represented by 
					operators. An operator could be denoted as \(A\) for the vector space. Operators act on kets 
					from left to right:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(A\cdot (\ket{\alpha}) = A\ket{\alpha}\)
				</p>

				<p>
					Our result is another ket. Most often, \(A\) is not a constant times \(\ket{\alpha}\). 
				</p>

				<p>
					Eigenkets of oeprator \(A\) are specific kets of importance denoted by:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(\ket{\alpha'},\ket{\alpha'''},\ket{\alpha'''},...\)
				</p>

				<p>
					The property can be written as:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(A\ket{\alpha'}=a'\ket{\alpha'},\;\;A\ket{\alpha''}=a''\ket{\alpha''}\)
				</p>

				<p>
					Values of \(a',a'',...\) are numbers. So what we are doing is taking our operator and 
					multiplying it by the eigenket. The set of numbers that make up the eigenket 
					\(\left\{a',a'',a''',...\right\}\) is called the set of eigenvalues of operator \(A\). The set of 
					eigenvalues can be more compactly denoted by \(\left\{a'\right\}\).
