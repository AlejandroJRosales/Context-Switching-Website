							An \(n\)-dimensional manifold, or \(n\)-manifold, is a topological space where
							each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset on \(n\)-dimensional
							Euclidean space.

							Which can be formally defined as:

						<!-- <p class="math-notation">

						<p>
							Let \(M\) be a topological space. A chart in \(M\)
							consists of an open subset \(U \subset M\) and a
							homomorphism \(h\) of \(U\) onto an open subset of \(R^{m}\). A \(C^{r}\) <i>atlas</i> on
							\(M\) is a
							collection \(\left\{U_{\alpha}, h_{\alpha}\right\}\) of charts such that the \(U_{\alpha}\)
							cover \(M\)
							and \(h_{\beta}h_{\alpha}^{-1}\), the transition maps, are \(C^{r}\) maps on
							\(h_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta})\).
						</p>

						<p>
							A maximal atlas \(C^{r}\) on our Manifold \(M\) is called a \(C^{r}\) structure. A manifold
							of class
							\(C^{r}\) that has a second coutnable Hausdorff space \(M\), and has a \(C^{r}\) structure

							Given an open subset \(U\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}\), a function \(f:U\rightarrow
							M\subset\mathbb{R}^{A}\), is smooth if for all functions
							\(f_{\alpha}:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) is smooth. Where \(R^{A}\) denotes the vector space of
							all functions \(x\). Given \(f\) is smooth, the partial derivative
							\(\frac{\partial_{f}}{\partial_{u_{i}}}\) is defined as a smooth function
							\(U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{A}\), where for the \(\alpha\)-th coordinate is
							\(\frac{\partial_{\alpha}}{\partial_{u_{i}}}\) for \(i=1,...,n\).
						</p>

						<p>
							A good method of studying smooth manifolds is by putting together the smooth manifold with
							smaller pieces.
							These smaller pieces themselves are not smooth manifolds, but rather manifolds with
							boundary. The
							definition of a manifold parallels a manifold definition (defined in the
							<a class="sliding-link" href="#manifolds">Manifolds</a>
							section) however, we need to update the definition of a homeomorphism. For a manifold with
							boundary,
							the homeomorphisms \(h_{\alpha}\) onto the open subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^{m}\) or
							\(\mathbb{R}^{m}_{+}\),
							where \(\mathbb{R}^{m}_{+}=\left\{(x_{1},...,x_{m})\in\mathbb{R}^{m}|\;x_{m}\ge 0\right\}\).
							Meaning, with
							our update when an open subset of our topological structure is passed through the
							homeomorphic functions
							\(h_{\alpha}\), it can now be
							mapped surjectively to the eucledian space of \(\mathbb{R}^{m}\) or \(\mathbb{R}^{m}_{+}\).
							Where for
							\(\mathbb{R}^{m}_{+}\), the last element in the ordered pair of real elements is \(\ge 0\).
							To put it
							succently, the transtion maps now become maps of open subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^{m}_{+}\).
							This type of map
							is
							smooth if it is locally a restriction of a smooth map defined on an open subset of
							\(\mathbb{R}^{m}\), by
							definition.

								For vector space we are refering to a set of vector elements that

								any field.
							</p>

							<p>
								Speaking more generally, for every point \(x\) of the space \(X\) we
								we associate a vector space \(V(x)\) such that these vector spaces fit

					<p>Topologoical vs Eucledian Space</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					Let us break this down. First, we will start with getting an idea of what a topological
					space is,
					since this is one of the first parts of our definition of a manifold.
					A topological space is roughly speaking where the closeness of the points in the space cannot be
					numerically
					defined, unlike in Euclidean space. What is Euclidean space? If you recall, in school we would plot
					a
					point
					in 2-d
					space using
					\((x, y)\) and an \(x\) and \(y\) axis with dashes along the side to help define the space between
					values. This is
					2-dimensional
					Euclidean space. Or written as \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\). Of course,
					our Euclidean space is not limited to 2 dimensions. We can use
					similar descriptors for 3-d space, 11-space, and any number of dimensions, or \(n\)-d Euclidean
					space
					\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\).
					However, continuing with 2-d space, using our numbered \(x\) and \(y\) axis and our points with
					coordinates, we
					can figure out the numerical value that represents how close one
					point is
					to other. However, a <i>topological</i>
					space, unlike our familiar <i>Eucledian</i> space,
					is more generalized than that. Rather, our space does not have a "numbered axis" to define one point
					relation
					to
					another.
					Rather our space is represented as a set of points whose elements are called points. In this set
					that
					defines
					our
					topological
					space, we have a structure called a topology. This topology is defined as a set of neighborhoods for
					every
					point
					that, by examining the other points or elements that are in this neighborhood set, gives an idea of
					closeness
					or relation of one point to another. So, we have a set of points that defines what makes up our
					topological
					space and a structure called a topology that is defined as a set of neighbors (neighborhoods are
					represents as
					sets too).

					So now we have a rough idea of the first part of our short version: "...is a topological space...".
					Mathematically, the part we examined was: Let \(M\) be a topological space.

				</div>
				<p>
					A topological structure, roughly speaking, is an additional structure to a topological space that
					can be
					defined as a
					set of neighborhoods. A neighborhood is closely related to an open subset. This is why in out
					definition
					when we take an element from our topology we get an open subset. i.e. \(U_{p} \in \tau_{M}\).
					Basically,
					a
					neighborhood of a point from a topological space is a set of points that contains that point and the
					points for which we can move around in any direction and still be in our set or neighborhood. This
					is
					why
					our point \(p\) that we have is an element of \(U\). Since when we take a point we want to examine a
					slice
					of our topology that contains the point we are examining and not some random point. We do this so we
					can
					keep properly traversing through our topology and keep a list of all of the charts and their
					respective
					homeomorphisms. This allows us to determine if all elements or open subsets in our topology when
					sent
					through their respective homeomorphisms, are a part of eucledian space \(R^{d}\). i.e. if parts of
					our
					topological space \(M\) examined locally are apart of eucledian space \(R^{d}\).
