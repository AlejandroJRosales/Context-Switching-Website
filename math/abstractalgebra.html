			<p>
				Abstract Algebra or modern algebra can be defined as the theory of algebraic
				structures. For the most part, modern abstract algebra deals with four
				algebraic structures: groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces. We will look at
				and examine these four algebraic strucutres in this page.

					<p>
						The three most commonly studied algebraic structures are groups, rings, and fields. Groups can be found
						in many areas of mathematics such as geometry, analysis, topology, and other fields as well.
					</p>

					<p>
						A group is a set \(G\) with one
						<a class="sliding-link" href="#binary-operations">binary operation</a> that adheres to the following
						(using multiplication or juxtaposition for this binary operation):
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>The operation is associative. So, for all \(g_{1}, g_{2}, g_{3} \in G\),
							\((g_{1}g_{2})g_{3} = g_{1}(g_{2}g_{3})\).</li>
						<li>There exists an identity for the operation. So, for all \(g \in G\), an element \(1 \in G\) such that
							\(1g = g\) and \(g1 = g.\)</li>
						<li>Every \(g \in G\) has an inverse for the operation. So, for all \(g \in G\) there exists
							\(g^{-1}\) with the property that \(gg^{-1}=1\) and \(g^{-1}g=1\)</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						If the operation is commutative along with 1, 2, and 3 above, then the group is an
						abelian group. The order of group \(G\) is the number of elements in \(G\), denoted
						as \(|G|\). \(G\) is an infinite group if \(|G| > \infty\), else \(G\) is a finite group.
					</p>

					<p>
						The integers \(\mathbb{Z}\), the rationals \(\mathbb{Q}\), and the reals \(\mathbb{R}\) all
						form groups under addition and are all albenian groups.
						The elements of the set of rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\) are not a group under
						multiplication because \(0\) does not have a multiplicative inverse. For a set to be
						closed under multiplication, any element \(x\) must have a multiplicative inverse
						\(-x\). The elemenet \(0 \in \mathbb{Q}\) under multpication \(\times\) does not
						have an inverse. However, the set of nonzero elements of \(\mathbb{Q}\) under multiplication
						is an abelian group. This is because the nonzero elements of \(\mathbb{Q}\) with one
						binary operation satisfies 1, 2, 3 above and is commutative under multiplication.

					<p>
						Binary Operations take two elments of a set and produce a new element that is a part of the
						same set. Binary Operations are fundemetal to Algebrai structures. Let \(S\) be a nonempty
						set. A binary operation on set \(S\) is a function from \(S \times S\) to \(S\). We can denote
						the image of the ordered pair \((a, b) \in S \times S\). We can poorly denote the binary opration by
						this image as \(ab \in S\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Put differently, a binary operation on a set \(S\) is given when every ordered pair (\(a,b)\) of
						elements of set \(S\) is an associated unique element \(c \in S\). A binary operation on on set
						\(S\) must be closed if \(c \in S\).
