				<p>
					A few days ago, I was looking at books at the book store and found a graduate level book on differential
					manifolds.
					I new nothing about mainfolds or topology, and I am not a math major. So I saw this as a way to learn about a
					topic
					I new nothing about, a way to challenge myslef, and I also am passionate about math since it is beautiful to
					look
					at. And I needed something new to do in my free time. Ultimetly, learning about this makes me happy.

						What is a manifold? One definition:
					</p>
					<p>
						\((M, \tau_{M}, A)\)
						<br>
						\(A: Atlas (U_{\alpha}, P_{\alpha})\)
						<br>
						\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Another definition:
					</p>
					<p>
						Let \(M\) be a topological space. A <i>chart</i> in \(M\)
						consits of an open subset \(U \subset M\) and a
						homoemorphism \(h\) of \(U\) onto an open subset of \(R^{m}\). A \(C^{r}\) <i>atlas</i> on \(M\) is a
						collection \(\left\{U_{\alpha}, h_{\alpha}\right\}\) of charts such that the \(U_{\alpha}\) cover \(M\)
						and \(h_{\beta}h_{\alpha}^{-1}\), the <i>transition maps</i>, are \(C^{r}\) maps on
						\(h_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta})\).

					<p>
						Ok, but I dont speak <b><i>squiggles</i></b>. Using no math notation,
						what
						is a manifold? Translate what the math notation above is saying.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>The short version</b>: a manifold is a
						topological space that locally resembles Eucliden
						space.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Medium version:</b> an \(n\)-dimensional manifold, or \(n\)-manifold, is a topological space where each
						point has a
						neighboorhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset on \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Long version:</b> Lets break this down. First we will start with getting an idea of what a topological
						space is,
						since this is one of the first parts of our defenition of a manifold.
						A topological space is roughly speaking where the closness of the points in the space cannot be
						numerically
						defined, unlike in Eucledian space. What is Eucledian space? If you recall, in school we would plot a point
						in 2-d
						space using
						(x, y) and an x and y axis with dashes along the side to help define the space between values. This is
						2-dimensional
						Eucledian space. Or written as \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\). Of course,
						our Eucledian space is not limited to 2 dimensions. We can use
						similar descriptors for 3-d space, 11-space, and any number of dimensions, or \(n\)-d Eucledian space
						\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\).
						However, continuing with 2-d space, using our numbered x and y axis and our points with coordinates, we
						can figure out the numerical value that represents how close one
						point is
						to other. However, a <i>topological</i>
						space, unlike our familiar <i>Eucledian</i> space,
						is more generalized than that. Rather, our space does not have "numbered axis" to define one points relation
						to
						another.
						Rather our space is represented as a set of points whose elements are called points. And in this set that
						defines
						our
						topological
						space, we have a structure called a topolgy. This topology is defined as a set of neighbourhoods for every
						point
						that, by examining the other points or elements that are in this neighborhood set, it gives an idea of
						closeness
						or relation of one point to another. So, we have a set of points that defines what makes up our topological
						space, and a structure called a topology that is defined as set of neighboords (neighboorhoods are
						represents as
						sets too).

						So now we have a rough idea of the first part of our short version: "...is a topological space...".
						Mathematically, the part we examined was: Let \(M\) be a topological space.
					</p>
					<!-- 						A topological space is a space whose elements are points for which their closness cannot be numerically
						defined.
						In this space there is an additional structure called a topology. This topology is defined as a <i>set</i>
						of neighbourhoods. A neighbourhood in topolgy is roughly defined as a set of points containing that point
						where we can move in any direction away from the point by some amount without leaving the set. i.e. our
						additional structure that we are looking at is a topology or geometric shape that exists in a topolgical
						space. It is important to note our topological space can be to \(m\) dimensions. Such as 2-d space, 3-d
						space,
						11-d space, \(m\)-d space, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						So now we have our space and the shape that exists in this space.
						What we need to do is define a method for which we can take any shape or topology, from a topological space
						in any amount of dimensions, and tells us whether our shape is a manifold.
					</p>
					<p>
						It helps to imagine intuitvley how we would do this. Image someone hands you a shape in our 3 dimmenisonal
						space, and asks you to tell them if the shape they handed you has a hole in it. A yes or not is all they
						need.
						You would pick up that shape, start rotating it in your hands to examine it at every point to see if there
						is
						a hole. What you are doing is looking at the shape one part at a time and seeing if you see a hole in that
						part. If that part has a hole, then you hole shape has a hole, because that smaller part you are examing,
						of course is apart of the shape as a hole. Thus, if the part has a hole, the shape has a hole
					</p>
					<p>
						This is similar to what we are doing to figure out if our shape is a manifold. What we will do is take a shape
						or topology that is in a topological space, examine it to see if if matches our criteria, and return whether
						it is a manifold. In the example, our response is based on whether or not the shape has a hole in it. For a
						manifold, it is based on whether or not our shape contains a part where 
						
						Our method is as follows.

						First what we do is we "cut" a piece of that shape and transfer it to a space 1 dimension below the number
						of
						dimensions in
						the original shape. This new space to examine the piece of this shape is called a chart. And to transfer
						this piece from \(n\) dimensions to \(n-1\) dimensions while stil mainting the strucure between this pieces
						vertices and edges, we use a homeomorphic function.
					</p> -->

					<!-- 					<br>

					<p>
						What is important to continue to remember is that our topolocial space is a <i>set</i> of elements
						that are points that define our geometircal space. So when we "cut" out a piece of this shape, what we are
						doing is take a proper subset of these elemements. Meaning we are taking a smaller set of elements that is
						not equal to our topolgical space. Mathematically this is how we "cut" out a piece of our shape.
