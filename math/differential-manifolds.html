				<p class="subsection-header" id="why-i-learn">Why I wanted to learn about this</p>
				<p>
					A few days ago, I was looking at books at the book store and saw a book on differential
					manifolds.
					I was flipping through the book, and did not understand a single thing except for the set theory
					notation.
					Since I am not a math major and clearly knew nothing about mainfolds or topology I thought
					to myself, "Oh, an unexplored field to learn about, cool!" Since it is a graduate mathematics book, it
					is going to be so much of a challenge. But eh, I needed something new to do in my free time anywho.
					Ultimetly, learning makes me happy, I love how beautiful math is, so why not!
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Caution:</b> As mentioned, I am not a math major, I am normal or below par at math, and this is a graduate
					level mathematics book. So
					there are bound to be mistakes I make and resulting corrections. So, take what I say with a grain
					of salt. This is a learning experience for both of us! With that said, lets dive into differential manifolds!

						What is a manifold? One definition:
					</p>
					<p>
						\((M, \tau_{M}, A)\)
						<br>
						\(A: Atlas (U_{\alpha}, P_{\alpha})\)
						<br>
						\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Basically, what I think this says that we have a point \(p\) that is an element of our topological space
						\(M\). Such that,
						our open subset \(U_{p}\) contains points from our topology in our topological space \(\tau_{M}\)
						that are neighboors to our point \(p\). i.e. our open subset has \(p\) as an element. Such that,
						there exists (\(\exists\)) <i>some</i> homeomorphic function \(P\) for our point \(p\) that
						when we pass our open subset \(U\) through the function, the range is a set that is
						apart or a subset of Eucledian space \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Another definition:
					</p>
					<p>
						Let \(M\) be a topological space. A <i>chart</i> in \(M\)
						consits of an open subset \(U \subset M\) and a
						homoemorphism \(h\) of \(U\) onto an open subset of \(R^{m}\). A \(C^{r}\) <i>atlas</i> on \(M\) is a
						collection \(\left\{U_{\alpha}, h_{\alpha}\right\}\) of charts such that the \(U_{\alpha}\) cover \(M\)
						and \(h_{\beta}h_{\alpha}^{-1}\), the <i>transition maps</i>, are \(C^{r}\) maps on
						\(h_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta})\).

						Ok, but I dont speak <b><i>squiggles</i></b>. Using no math notation,
						what
						is a manifold? Translate what the math notation above is saying.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>The short version</b>: a manifold is a
						topological space that locally resembles Eucliden
						space.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Medium version:</b> an \(n\)-dimensional manifold, or \(n\)-manifold, is a topological space where each
						point has a
						neighboorhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset on \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space.

						We will look at and break into pieces the following definition of a manifold:
					</p>

					<p>
						\((M, \tau_{M}, A)\)
						<br>
						\(A: Atlas (U_{\alpha}, P_{\alpha})\)
						<br>
						\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						First: Lets look at elements in our ordered-pair that define our manifold:
					</p>

					<p>
						\((M, \tau_{M}, A)\)
					</p>

					<div class="subsubsection-header-div">
						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="topological-space">\(M\) Topological Space</p>
						<p>
							Lets break this down. First we will start with getting an idea of what a topological
							space is,
							since this is one of the first parts of our defenition of a manifold.
							A topological space is roughly speaking where the closness of the points in the space cannot be
							numerically
							defined, unlike in Eucledian space. What is Eucledian space? If you recall, in school we would plot a
							point
							in 2-d
							space using
							(x, y) and an x and y axis with dashes along the side to help define the space between values. This is
							2-dimensional
							Eucledian space. Or written as \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\). Of course,
							our Eucledian space is not limited to 2 dimensions. We can use
							similar descriptors for 3-d space, 11-space, and any number of dimensions, or \(n\)-d Eucledian space
							\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\).
							However, continuing with 2-d space, using our numbered x and y axis and our points with coordinates, we
							can figure out the numerical value that represents how close one
							point is
							to other. However, a <i>topological</i>
							space, unlike our familiar <i>Eucledian</i> space,
							is more generalized than that. Rather, our space does not have "numbered axis" to define one points
							relation
							to
							another.
							Rather our space is represented as a set of points whose elements are called points. And in this set that
							defines
							our
							topological
							space, we have a structure called a topolgy. This topology is defined as a set of neighbourhoods for every
							point
							that, by examining the other points or elements that are in this neighborhood set, it gives an idea of
							closeness
							or relation of one point to another. So, we have a set of points that defines what makes up our
							topological
							space, and a structure called a topology that is defined as set of neighboords (neighboorhoods are
							represents as
							sets too).

							So now we have a rough idea of the first part of our short version: "...is a topological space...".
							Mathematically, the part we examined was: Let \(M\) be a topological space.

						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="topology">\(\tau_{M}\) Topology</p>
					</div>

					<div class="subsubsection-header-div">
						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="atlas">\(A\) Atlas</p>
					</div>

					<p>
						Next: Lets look at elements in our ordered-pair that define our Atlas \(A\) of our manifold:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(A: Atlas (U_{\alpha}, P_{\alpha})\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally: Lets talk about the way all of these parts fit in respect to eachother:
					</p>

					<p>
						\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
					</p>

					<div class="subsubsection-header-div">
						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="translation">Translation</p>
						<p>
							\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							This says that we have a point \(p\) that is an element of our topological space \(M\). Such that,
							our open subset \(U_{p}\) contains points from our topology in our topological space \(\tau_{M}\)
							that are neighboors to our point \(p\). i.e. our open subset has (\p\) as an element. Such that,
							there exists (\(\exists\)) <i>some</i> homeomorphic function \(P\) for our point \(p\) that
							when we pass our open subset \(U\) through the function, the range is a set that is
							apart or a subset of Eucledian space \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\).
						</p>

						<p>
							i.e. there is <i>a</i> function that when we send through apart of our topological space, we
							can get something that is apart of Eucledian space. And, there is an atlas that is a collection
							of all of the charts and respective transition functions to translate them to Eucledian space,
							for the topological space. That, when we put all of our chart together in the atlas, we recieve
							a correct version of our topological space.
