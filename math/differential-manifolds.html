				<p>
					A few days ago, I was looking at books at the book store and found a graduate level book on differential
					manifolds.
					I new nothing about mainfolds or topology, and I am not a math major. So I saw this as a way to learn about
					a
					topic
					I new nothing about, a way to challenge myslef, and I also am passionate about math since it is beautiful to
					look
					at. And I needed something new to do in my free time. Ultimetly, learning about this makes me happy.

						What is a manifold? One definition:
					</p>
					<p>
						\((M, \tau_{M}, A)\)
						<br>
						\(A: Atlas (U_{\alpha}, P_{\alpha})\)
						<br>
						\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						Another definition:
					</p>
					<p>
						Let \(M\) be a topological space. A <i>chart</i> in \(M\)
						consits of an open subset \(U \subset M\) and a
						homoemorphism \(h\) of \(U\) onto an open subset of \(R^{m}\). A \(C^{r}\) <i>atlas</i> on \(M\) is a
						collection \(\left\{U_{\alpha}, h_{\alpha}\right\}\) of charts such that the \(U_{\alpha}\) cover \(M\)
						and \(h_{\beta}h_{\alpha}^{-1}\), the <i>transition maps</i>, are \(C^{r}\) maps on
						\(h_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta})\).

					<p>
						<b>Medium version:</b> an \(n\)-dimensional manifold, or \(n\)-manifold, is a topological space where each

						neighboorhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset on \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space.

							Lets break this down. First we will start with getting an idea of what a topological
							space is,
							since this is one of the first parts of our defenition of a manifold.
							A topological space is roughly speaking where the closness of the points in the space cannot be
							numerically
							defined, unlike in Eucledian space. What is Eucledian space? If you recall, in school we would plot a
							point
							in 2-d
							space using
							(x, y) and an x and y axis with dashes along the side to help define the space between values. This is
							2-dimensional
							Eucledian space. Or written as \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\). Of course,
							our Eucledian space is not limited to 2 dimensions. We can use
							similar descriptors for 3-d space, 11-space, and any number of dimensions, or \(n\)-d Eucledian space
							\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\).
							However, continuing with 2-d space, using our numbered x and y axis and our points with coordinates, we
							can figure out the numerical value that represents how close one
							point is
							to other. However, a <i>topological</i>
							space, unlike our familiar <i>Eucledian</i> space,
							is more generalized than that. Rather, our space does not have "numbered axis" to define one points
							relation
							to
							another.
							Rather our space is represented as a set of points whose elements are called points. And in this set that
							defines
							our
							topological
							space, we have a structure called a topolgy. This topology is defined as a set of neighbourhoods for every
							point
							that, by examining the other points or elements that are in this neighborhood set, it gives an idea of
							closeness
							or relation of one point to another. So, we have a set of points that defines what makes up our
							topological
							space, and a structure called a topology that is defined as set of neighboords (neighboorhoods are
							represents as
							sets too).

							So now we have a rough idea of the first part of our short version: "...is a topological space...".
							Mathematically, the part we examined was: Let \(M\) be a topological space.
