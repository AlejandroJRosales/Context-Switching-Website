							What is a manifold?
						</p>

						<p>
							One definition of a manifold with a topology:
						</p>

						<p class="math-notation">
							\((M, \tau_{M}, A)\)
							<br>
							\(A: Atlas (U_{\alpha}, P_{\alpha})\)
							<br>
							\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							This says is that we have a point \(p\) that is an element of our topological
							space
							\(M\). Such that,
							our open subset \(U_{p}\) is an element of our topology in our topological space \(\tau_{M}\)
							that has our point \(p\) in \(U\). i.e. from the set of neighboors or set of elements that are apart of
							our topology \(\tau_{M}\), the open subset \(U\) we choose needs the point \(p\) as an element of that
							set. Such that,
							there exists <i>some</i> \(\exists\) homeomorphic function \(P\) for our point \(p\) that
							when we pass our open subset \(U\) through the function, the range is a set that is
							apart or a proper subset of Eucledian space \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\). Our atlas \(A\) is
							defined as an ordered pair with a set of open subsets \(U_{\alpha}\) a set of their respective
							homeomorphisms \(P_{\alpha}\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Another definition of a manifold without a topology:
						</p>
						<p>
							Let \(M\) be a topological space. A <i>chart</i> in \(M\)
							consits of an open subset \(U \subset M\) and a
							homoemorphism \(h\) of \(U\) onto an open subset of \(R^{m}\). A \(C^{r}\) <i>atlas</i> on \(M\) is a
							collection \(\left\{U_{\alpha}, h_{\alpha}\right\}\) of charts such that the \(U_{\alpha}\) cover \(M\)
							and \(h_{\beta}h_{\alpha}^{-1}\), the <i>transition maps</i>, are \(C^{r}\) maps on
							\(h_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta})\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Similar to what we have above, except here our open subset \(U\) is a proper subset of our topological
							space \(M\) instead of a topology that is an additional structure in the topological space.

							Ok, but I dont speak <b><i>squiggles</i></b>. Using no math notation,
							what
							is a manifold? Translate what the math notation above is saying.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>The short version</b>: a manifold is a
							topological space that locally resembles Eucliden
							space.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Medium version:</b> an \(n\)-dimensional manifold, or \(n\)-manifold, is a topological space where
							each
							point has a
							neighboorhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset on \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space.

						We will look at and break into pieces the following definition of a manifold:
					</p>

					<p class="math-notation">
						\((M, \tau_{M}, A)\)
						<br>
						\(A: Atlas (U_{\alpha}, P_{\alpha})\)
						<br>
						\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
					</p>

					<p>
						First: Lets look at elements in our ordered-pair that define our manifold:
					</p>

					<p class="math-notation">
						\((M, \tau_{M}, A)\)
					</p>

					<div class="subsubsection-header-div">

						<div class="categories" style="overflow: hidden;">
							<p>Topologoical vs Eucledian Space</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							Lets break this down. First we will start with getting an idea of what a topological
							space is,
							since this is one of the first parts of our defenition of a manifold.
							A topological space is roughly speaking where the closness of the points in the space cannot be
							numerically
							defined, unlike in Eucledian space. What is Eucledian space? If you recall, in school we would plot a
							point
							in 2-d
							space using
							(x, y) and an x and y axis with dashes along the side to help define the space between values. This is
							2-dimensional
							Eucledian space. Or written as \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\). Of course,
							our Eucledian space is not limited to 2 dimensions. We can use
							similar descriptors for 3-d space, 11-space, and any number of dimensions, or \(n\)-d Eucledian space
							\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\).
							However, continuing with 2-d space, using our numbered x and y axis and our points with coordinates, we
							can figure out the numerical value that represents how close one
							point is
							to other. However, a <i>topological</i>
							space, unlike our familiar <i>Eucledian</i> space,
							is more generalized than that. Rather, our space does not have "numbered axis" to define one points
							relation
							to
							another.
							Rather our space is represented as a set of points whose elements are called points. And in this set
							that
							defines
							our
							topological
							space, we have a structure called a topolgy. This topology is defined as a set of neighbourhoods for
							every
							point
							that, by examining the other points or elements that are in this neighborhood set, it gives an idea of
							closeness
							or relation of one point to another. So, we have a set of points that defines what makes up our
							topological
							space, and a structure called a topology that is defined as set of neighboords (neighboorhoods are
							represents as
							sets too).

							So now we have a rough idea of the first part of our short version: "...is a topological space...".
							Mathematically, the part we examined was: Let \(M\) be a topological space.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="subsubsection-header-div">
						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="topology">\(\tau_{M}\) Topology</p>
						<div class="categories" style="overflow: hidden;">
							<p>Open Subsets</p>
							<p>Neighboorhoods</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							A topology, roughly speaking, is an additional structure to a topolgical space that can be defined as a
							set of neighboorhoods. A neighboorhood is closely related to an open subset. This is why in out
							definition
							when we take an element from our toplogy we get an open subset. i.e. \(U_{p} \in \tau_{M}\). Basically,
							a
							neighboorhood of a point from a topological space is a set of points that contains that point and the
							points for which we can move around in any direction and still be in our set or neighboorhood. This is
							why
							our point \(p\) that we have is an element of \(U\). Since when we take a point we want to examine a
							slice
							of our topology that contains the point we are examining and not some random point. We do this so we can
							keep properly traverse through our topology and keep a list of all of the chart and their respective
							homeomoprhisms. This allows us to determine if all elements or open subsets in our topology, when sent
							through their respective homeomorphisms, are apart of eucledian space \(R^{d}\). i.e. if parts of our
							topological space \(M\) examined locally are apart of eucledian space \(R^{d}\).

					<div class="subsubsection-header-div">
						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="atlas">\(A\) Atlas</p>
					</div>

					<p>
						Next: Lets look at elements in our ordered-pair that define our Atlas \(A\) of our manifold:
					</p>

					<p class="math-notation">
						\(A: Atlas (U_{\alpha}, P_{\alpha})\)
					</p>

					<div class="subsubsection-header-div">
						<p class="subsubsection-header" id="final-piece">Final Piece</p>
						<p>
							Finally: Lets talk about the way all of these parts fit in respect to eachother:
						</p>

						<p class="math-notation">
							\(p \in M : U_{p} \in \tau_{M} : \exists P_{p} : U \rightarrow P_{p}(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							This says is that we have a point \(p\) that is an element of our topological
							space
							\(M\). Such that,
							our open subset \(U_{p}\) is an element of our topology in our topological space \(\tau_{M}\)
							that has our point \(p\) in \(U\). i.e. from the set of neighboors or set of elements that are apart of
							our topology \(\tau_{M}\), the open subset \(U\) we choose needs the point \(p\) as an element of that
							set. Such that,
							there exists <i>some</i> \(\exists\) homeomorphic function \(P\) for our point \(p\) that
							when we pass our open subset \(U\) through the function, the range is a set that is
							apart or a proper subset of Eucledian space \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\).
						</p>

						<p>
							i.e. there is <i>a</i> function that when we send through apart of our topological space, we
							can get something that is apart of Eucledian space. And, there is an atlas that is a collection
							of all of the charts and respective transition functions to translate them to Eucledian space,
							for the topological space. That, when we put all of our chart together in the atlas, we recieve
							a correct version of our topological space.
