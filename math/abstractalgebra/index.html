			<p>
				Abstract Algebra or modern algebra can be defined as the theory of algebraic
				structures. For the most part, abstract algebra deals with four
				algebraic structures: groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces. We will look at
				and examine these four algebraic strucutres in this page.
			</p>

						Isomorphisms</p>
					<p>
						The three most commonly studied algebraic structures are groups, rings, and fields. Groups can
						be found
						in many areas of mathematics such as geometry, analysis, topology, and other fields as well. We
						will continue with formal definitions.
					</p>

					<p>
						A group is a set \(G\) with one
						<a class="sliding-link" href="#binary-operations">binary operation</a> that adheres to the
						following
						(using multiplication or juxtaposition for this binary operation):
					</p>

					<p>
					<ol>
						<li>The operation is associative. So, for all \(g_{1}, g_{2}, g_{3} \in G\),
							\((g_{1}g_{2})g_{3} = g_{1}(g_{2}g_{3})\).</li>
						<li>There exists an identity for the operation. So, for all \(g \in G\), an element \(1 \in G\)
							such that
							\(1g = g\) and \(g1 = g.\)</li>
						<li>Every \(g \in G\) has an inverse for the operation. So, for all \(g \in G\) there exists
							\(g^{-1}\) with the property that \(gg^{-1}=1\) and \(g^{-1}g=1\)</li>
					</ol>
					</p>

					<p>
						If the operation is commutative along with 1, 2, and 3 above, then the group is an
						abelian group. The order of group \(G\) is the number of elements in \(G\), denoted
						as \(|G|\). If \(|G| > \infty\), then \(G\) is an infinite group if, othewise \(G\) is a finite
						group.
					</p>

					<p>
						The integers \(\mathbb{Z}\), rationals \(\mathbb{Q}\), and reals \(\mathbb{R}\) all
						form groups under addition and are all albenian groups.
						The elements of the set of rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\) are not a group under
						multiplication because \(0\) does not have a multiplicative inverse. For a set to be
						closed under multiplication, any element \(x\) must have a multiplicative inverse
						\(-x\). The elemenet \(0 \in \mathbb{Q}\) under multpication \(\times\) does not
						have an inverse. However, the set of nonzero elements of \(\mathbb{Q}\) under multiplication
						is an abelian group. This is because the nonzero elements of \(\mathbb{Q}\) with one
						binary operation satisfies 1, 2, 3 above and is commutative under multiplication.

						A ring, formally defined, is a set \(R\) with two binary operations defined in the set. The
						two binary operations are normally called addition \(+\) and multiplication denoted as \(\cdot\)
						or
						by juxtaposition. The binary operations satisfy the following six axioms: (Note: the operations
						"addition" and "multiplication" may be very different from the usual addition and mutiplication
						of
						numbers)
					</p>

					<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Addition is commutative. Meaning, \(a+b=b+a\) for every pair \(a,b\in R\).</li>
						<li>Addition is associative. Meaning, \(a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c\) for \(a,b,c\in R\).</li>
						<li>There exists an additive identity, denoted by 0. Meaning, that \(a+b=a\) for every \(a\in
							R\).</li>
						<li>For every \(a\in R\) there exsists some additive inverse denoted by \(-a\) such that
							\(a+(-a)=0\).</li>
						<li>Multiplication is associative. Meaning, \(a(bc)=(ab)c\) for \(a;b;c\in R\).</li>
						<li>Multiplication is left and right distributive and right distributive over addition. Meaning,
							\(a(b+c)=ab+ac\) and \((b+c)a=ba+ca\) for for \(a;b;c\in R\).</li>
						<br>
						<i>Further, if the binary operations on set \(R\) also satisfy the following axiom:</i>
						<br>
						<br>
						<li>Multiplication is commutative then \(R\) is a commutative ring. Meaning, \(ab=ba\) for every
							pair
							\(a,b\in
							R\).</li>
						<br>
						<i>Further, if for the binary operations on set \(R\):</i>
						<br>
						<br>
						<li>There exsists a multiplicative identity denoted by \(1\) such that \(a\cdot 1=a\) and
							\(1\cdot a=a\)
							for
							every \(a\in R\) then \(R\) is a ring with identity. If \(R\) satisfies axioms 1 through 6
							and 8 but not
							7, then
							\(R\) is a ring with unity.</li>
						<li>Satify axioms 1 through 8 then \(R\) is a commutative ring with an identity or a unity.</li>
					</ol>
					</p>

					<p>
						Recall that a set \(G\) with one operation, say \(+\), defined on it and satisfies axioms 1
						through 4 is
						called an abelian group. This means each ring is an abelian group, since, relative to the
						operration
						\(+\) axioms 1 through 4 for a ring must be satisified by definition.
					</p>

					<p>
						Looking now at the basic number number systems \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathbb{Q}\), and
						\(\mathbb{R}\),
						are examples of rings, both commutative and noncommutative. We will see that the ring algebraic
						structure
						is prevalent in mathematics.
					</p>

					<p>
						For some definitions, a ring \(R\) with only one elmenet is called trivial. The ring is trivial
						if and
						only if \(0=1\) according to the binary oprations in \(R\). A finite ring is a ring \(R\) with a
						finite
						number of elements, otherwise \(R\) is an infinite ring. Looking back at our basic number
						systems,
						\(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathbb{Q}\), and \(\mathbb{R}\) are all infinite rings.

						To continue.

						We will look at extending the concept of two and three dimensional vectors to an arbitary
						\(n\) dimensions. To do this, we will take certain properties of \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\) an use
						them as definitions in higher dimensions.
					</p>

					<p>
						First, consider the set \(\mathbb{R}^{n}=\left\{(x_{1},...,x_{n}):x_{i}\in\mathbb{R}\right\}\).
						To represent a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) we use an \(n\)-tuple \(\vec{v}=(x_{1},...,x_{n})\)
						and
						to represent the component or coordinate of the vector \(\vec{v}\) we use \(x_{i}\). If
						\(\vec{u}=(x_{1},...,x_{n}), \vec{v}=(y_{1},...,y_{n})\) then:

						The vector \(\vec{0}=(0,...,0)\) is called the zero vector.

						Binary Operations take two elments of a set and produce a new element that is a part of the
						same set. Binary Operations are fundemetal to Algebrai structures. Let \(S\) be a nonempty
						set. A binary operation on set \(S\) is a function from \(S \times S\) to \(S\). We can denote
						the image of the ordered pair \((a, b) \in S \times S\). We can poorly denote the binary
						opration by
						this image as \(ab \in S\).
					</p>

					<p>
						Put differently, a binary operation on a set \(S\) is given when every ordered pair (\(a,b)\) of
						elements of set \(S\) is an associated unique element \(c \in S\). A binary operation on on set
						\(S\) must be closed if \(c \in S\).
