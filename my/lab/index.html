        <b>About</b>: This one is coming soon!! Music is another field that has mirrored my passion and love for technology for most of my life. I played my first note on the piano at 1 and a half. (There's a picture of me doing so somewhere). Got my first guitar at 6, and my second one at 9. I picked up a cello the same size as me at 10, followed by playing collections of notes on the piano at 12. And though the increment of time between notes I play on my instruments varies throughout all the years, I have and will always continue to play because I love them all the same and enjoy them all differently. And, after so many years I can proudly say, that I am equally horrible at playing all of them. Just not good at any of them. I don't know why. But, that's ok, because I don't mind playing instruments badly. At least, I try not to. I play musical instruments because I love it expresses what mathematical and literay "instruments" cannot. I love all of its missed notes, off beats, and accidentals; it's perfectly imperfect. But I digress, by posting my music here, I continue with the theme of sharing what I am passionate about, even if I am bad at it. But, you know, if I play and others want to clap and cheer, I mean, I wouldn't say no... Anyway, I am so excited to get this part set up here soon!!

        <br>
        <b>About</b>: Applying a Quantum Support Vector Machine for credit card fraud detection in Qiskit. The applied
        QSVM makes use of quantum enhanced feature space optimization based on the research paper, Supervised Learning
        with Quantum Enhanced Feature Spaces. The classifier used is a Variational Quantum Classifier with
        29-dimensional ZZ feature mapping for a 2-qubit quantum kernel... <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

        <b>Abstract</b>:
        Current problem: limitations on successful solution for problems when feature
        space becomes large high-dimensional<br>
        Suggested solution: utilize controlled entanglement and interference to exploit
        exponentially growing quantum state space<br>
        Goal: present new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy
        intermediate scale quantum computers to machine learning for improved
        computational power and efficacy
