			My name is Alejandro Rosales, and I coded this website from scratch. It's not much, but it's honest
			work. I have a Bachelors of
			Science in Computer
			Science with a minor in Philosophy and concentration in Statistics. I am working on my Masters of Science in
			Computer Science, focusing on high-performance computing with an emphasis on quantum computing. My strongest
			skills are problem-solving, using abstract
			and
			deductive thinking, creativity,
			as well as
			inviting skills, knowledge, and expertise of others.
			<br><br>I love learning new things and pursing a deeper understanding of anything and everything. I also
			have a lot of fun problem solving and being creative, so naturally, I enjoy optimizing and building new
			things; things generally, technology especially. For example, computer programs I enjoyed building in my
			free time include, but of course are not limited to, machine learning programs, mobile apps, AWS cloud based
			programs,
			encryption programs, classical AI programs, stock trading algorithms, simulations, and websites! You can
			view
			the code for those programs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

		<p style="margin-top: 4em;"></p>

		<p id="about-pets">
			This website I built is dedicated to both PK (Puppy-Kitty), pictured with one of his favorite toys, and
			Lucy,
			pictured at one of her favorite spots. They were my best boy and best girl and forever favorite chapters in
			my life.

			I enjoy supporting and sharing the work of passionate people as well. So, to continue with that theme and
			the theme of cool, please go checkout the amazing work of ya girl Hannah Culver over on her website,
			Hannah's Hub:

			Two quotes I like are, "curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought them back." As well as, "be kind,
			for everyone you meet is fighting a
			hard battle."
		</p>

		<p>
			Uh, what else am I forgetting for these ice breakers, oh yeah! Lastly, my hobbies are playing the piano,
			cello, chess, sports, and learning about random stuff! Oh, and I can't wink, for whatever reason.
