			My name is Alejandro Rosales, and I coded this website from scratch. It's not much, but it's honest
			work. I have a Bachelors of
			Science in Computer
			Science with a minor in Philosophy and concentration in Statistics. I am working on my Masters of Science in
			Computer Science, focusing on high-performance computing with an  emphasis on quantum computing. My strongest skills are problem-solving, using abstract
			and
			deductive thinking, creativity,
			as well as
			inviting skills, knowledge, and expertise of others.
			<br><br>I love learning new things and pursing a deeper understanding of anything and everything. I also have a lot of fun problem solving and being creative, so naturally, I enjoy optimizing and building new
			things; things generally, technology especially. For example, computer programs I enjoyed building in my
			free time include, but of course are not limited to, machine learning programs, mobile apps, AWS cloud based
			programs,
			encryption programs, classical AI programs, stock trading algorithms, simulations, and websites! You can view
			the code for those programs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/AlejandroJRosales">here</a> or you can try running the code with the click of a button <a href="/my/projects">here</a>. Note, this page is in active development and is a beta release for now.

			This website I built is dedicated to both PK (Puppy-Kitty), pictured with one of his favorite toys, and Lucy,
			pictured at one of her favorite spots. They were my best boy and best girl.

      I love supporting and recognizing the work of passionate people; people generally, family and friends especially. So, to continue with the theme of cool, please go and checkout the amazing work of ya girl Hanna Culver over on her website, Hannah's Hub:

      My favorite song is, Saturn by Sleeping at Last. If you are curious, here is a hyperlink to a lyric video of the song:

      Two quotes I like are, "curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought them back." As well as, "be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a
      hard battle." Lastly, my hobbies are playing the piano, cello, chess, sports, or learning about random stuff for fun!
