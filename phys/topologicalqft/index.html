				<p>
					Topological quantum field theory TQFT in physics uses the zero-energy sector of the
					Hilbert space of states that does not include time, which the Hamiltonian eliminates.
					Mathematically, TQFT is used as an organizing structure for topological or differential
					invariant manifolds. A \(D\)-dimensional TQFT as a symmetric monoidal factor is given as:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(Z:\left(\mathscr{B}ord_D^{o r}, \amalg\right) \rightarrow(V ect, \otimes)\)
				</p>

				<p>
					\(\mathscr{B}ord_D^{o r}\) is a category of compact objects, boundary-less oriented
					\((D-1)\)-dimensional
					manifolds, where morphisms are oriented \(n\)-dimensional bordisms, modulo
					diffeomorphism relative to the boundary. The bordism has an incoming and outgoing boundary,
					however, in an oriented world the boundary orientation can be compared on each component with
					independent orientation.
				</p>

				<p>
					The bordism category has a symmetric monoidal structure defined by the disjoint union. This
					structure
					has an associative and commutative multiplication functor:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(\amalg: \mathscr{B}ord_D^{o r} \times \mathscr{B}ord_D^{o r} \rightarrow \mathscr{B}ord_D^{o r}\)
				</p>

				<p>
					Note, that multiplication for the category of vector spaces is similar, however, it is instead
					defined by the tensor product and is called the tensor structure. This structure includes
					additional linearity properties of \(V ect\) and the bi-linearity of \(\otimes\).
				</p>

				<p>
					To continue, we will look first at finite group gauge theory as it realtes to TQFT,
					two-dimensional guage theory, extended TQFT, cobordism hypothesis in dimensions 1 and 2, and then
					look at cobordism hypothesis in a higher dimension. Let's begin!

				</p>

				<div class="subsection-header-div">
					<p class="subsection-header" id="two-dim-guage-theory">Two-Dimensional Gauge Theory</p>
					<p>
						First let us look at an example of finite group guage theory \(Z_F\) that does not use
						orientations. Here, \(Z_F\) is associated with a finite group \(F\). It can be
						constructed relatively eaiser than others in higher dimensions, however, the theory
						can only detect fundamental groups of manifolds. First, let the groupoid of principal
						\(F\)-bundles over some manifold \(X\) be denoted by \(\text {B}un_F (X)\). Let's,
						consider a closed \(D\)-dimensional Manifold \(M\), such that \(Z_F\) will assign
						the number of isomorphism classes that is a part of principal \(F\)-bundles on \(M\) where each
						is weighted down by its automorphism group. Looking at \(M\), the assigned number
						is equal to \(\# H o m\left(\pi_1(M), F\right) / \# F\). This means that
						in one dimension, \(Z_F\left(S^1\right)=1\).
