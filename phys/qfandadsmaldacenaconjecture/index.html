          <p>
            We will look at how to obtain the Einstein frame \(S_{E}\) in \(10\)-dimensional AdS spacetime.
            Let's look at applying the effective low-energy string action for type II (A or B) strings for the string
            frame \(S_{s}\):
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\(S_{s}= -s \frac{1}{16 \pi G_{D}} {\displaystyle \int } d^{D} x \sqrt{|g|} \)
            \( \left( e^{-2 \phi}\left(R+4 g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi\right) \right. \)
            \( -\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \frac{1}{n !} F_n^2 +\ldots\big)\)
          </p>

          <p>
            where the Newton constant is in \(D\)-dimensions. The \(\ldots\) represent fermionic terms and NS-NS 3-form
            field strength term, \(\phi\) is the dialation, and \(n\)-form field strengths \(F_{n}\) that are apart of
            the sector \(RR\). For the Newton constant in \(D\)-dimensions \(16 \pi G_D=2 \kappa_D^2\). When the
            Minkowski Signature \(s=-1(+1)\) flips to the "mostly minus" signature, an additional \((-)^{n}\) is
            added in front of \(F^{2}_{n}\). For IIA strings (IIB strings) only odd frames exist for \(n\) and for IIB
            string \(n=5\) in Minkowski space the field strength tensor is self-dual. Where a self-dual tensor satisfies
            \(*F=F\Rightarrow
            F=**F\).
          </p>

          <p>Now, we will show that by adopting the low energy string action action above, we are able to derive the <a
              class="sliding-link" href="#einsteins-equations">equations of motion</a> while imposing self-duality and
            ensuring that the
            normalization of \(F^{2}_{5}\) is unchanged. It is convient to represent the actions for fields in
            the Einstein frame by first rescaling the strings, which can be accomplished using a specific type of Wely
            rescaling.
          </p>

          <p>
            To validate it is sufficient to adopt the effective low energy action for type II strings in
            order to derive the equations of motions while imposing self-duality for \(D\)-spacetime dimensions, we
            consider the following implication:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\( g_{\mu \nu} \rightarrow e^{2\ \sigma \phi}\Rightarrow \)
            \( \sqrt{|g|} e^{-2 \phi} R \rightarrow\)
            \( \sqrt{|g|} e^{-\phi(\sigma(D-2)+2)} \left\{ R+2 \sigma(D-1)\right. \)
            \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}} \partial_\mu\big(\sqrt{|g|} \partial^{\mu} \phi\big) -\sigma^{2} (D-1) \)
            \( \left. (D-2)(\partial \phi)^{2} \right\} \)
          </p>

          <p>
            Using this implication, we can see it is sufficient to adopt the string action to derive the equations
            of motions and imposing self-duality. Thus, we can now continue in good conscience.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will let \(\sigma=-\frac{2}{D-2}\). By choosing this value for \(\sigma\), we can remove a total
            derivative when applied in \(10\)-dimensions, which gives:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\(g_{\mu \nu}(\text { Einstein })=e^{-\frac{1}{2} \phi} g_{\mu \nu}(\text { string })\)
          </p>

          <p>
            From the equation above, we can see that the result for a string action is equivalent to result of the
            Einstein-Hilbert action in
            AdS spacetime. Continuing in \(10\)-dimensional spacetime, we obtain our Einstein
            frame as:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\( S_{E}= -s \frac{1}{16 \pi G_{10}} {\displaystyle \int } d^{10} x \sqrt{|g|} \)
            \( \left( R-\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi\right. \)
            \( \left.-\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \frac{1}{n !} e^{a_{n}\phi} F_n^2+\ldots\right) \)
          </p>

          <p>
            where \(a_n=-\frac{1}{2}(n-5)\). From this equation, we can recognize the Minkowksi metric \(g_{\mu \nu}\)
            and the Minkowski Euclidean signature \(s=-1(+1)\) paired with the Newton constant in \(D\)-dimensions
            \(16 \pi G_D\). We also see the familiarity of this equation to the Einstein-Hilbert action, where, if you
            recall, the Einstein-Hilbert action is:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\(S=-s \frac{1}{16 \pi G_D} {\displaystyle \int } d^D x \sqrt{|g|}(R+\Lambda)\)
          </p>

          <p>
            All-in-all, in this section we validated that adopting the low-energy string action for the
            Einstein-Hilbert action is sufficent for calcuating Einsteins equations of motions and imposing
            self-duality, specifically, in \(10\)-dimensional AdS spacetime. Therefore, yay! We have now
            derived an Einstein frame \(S_{E}\) in \(10\)-dimensional AdS spacetime implementing string
            theory!

            We will look at low-energy M-theory in the form of \(11\)-dimensional super gravity, where the bosonic
            part of the action in the Einstein frame is:

            \(\left.{\displaystyle \int } C \wedge K \wedge K \right)\)

          <p>
            such that there is no dilation \(\phi\) like we saw with \(10\)-dimensional spacetime. The bosonic field
            is the metric with a \(3\)-form guage potential \(C\) with a \(4\)-frame field strength tensor. We can
            denote this bosonic field as:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\(K=dC\)
          </p>

          <p>
            Meaning that when moving from \(10\)-dimensional spacetime to \(11\)-dimensional spacetime, we switch from
            the fermionic field to the bosonic field.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note, that we can still provide classical based solutions of the above theories. An example of a classic
            based solution, is by considering static solutions to flat translationally invariant \(p\)-branes,
            isotropic in transverse directions. For these
            static solutions and to cover all cases for classical based solutions in \(11\)-dimensional supergravity,
            we can use the following generic action:

        <div class="subsection-header-div">
          <p class="subsection-header" id="adsnplus1-boundary">Boundary on (n+1)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter Space</p>
          <p>
            AdS space has a projective boundary to allow for the embedding space \((y^{0},y^{\mu})\) in \(AdS_{n+1}\)
            for some very large \(y\). These new variables are defined as \(y^a=R \tilde{y}^a\), \(u=R \tilde{u}\),
            \(v=R \tilde{v}\), where \(R \rightarrow \infty\). Next, given the implication \(y^2=b^2 \Rightarrow
            \tilde{u} \tilde{v}-\vec{\tilde{y}}^2=\)\(b^2 / R^2 \rightarrow 0\), we can infer that the boundary in
            \(AdS_{d+1}\) space is a manifold, defined as \(\tilde{u} \tilde{v}-\vec{\tilde{y}}^2=0\). Since
            \(t\in\mathbb{R}\) is sufficent for \(R\), we then continue by considering the boundary to be the projective
            equivalence classes:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\(\begin{aligned}u v-\vec{y}^2 & =0 \\
            (u, v, \vec{y}) & \sim t(u, v, \vec{y})\end{aligned}\)
          </p>

          <p>
            Meaning, that, as defined above, since our initial state of the manifold boundary is asympotically
            equivalent to that manifold state on any \(t\) the boundary is \(n\)-dimensional. Next, we apply equivalence
            scaling on the boundary, such that the boundary can be represented with the Minkowski signature as
            \(\left(y^0\right)^2+\left(y^{n+1}\right)^2=1\)\(=\vec{y}^2\), where topologically the boundary is
            \(S^{1}\times S^{n+1}\).
          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes when scaling, the points with \(v\neq 0\) scale to \(v=1\), so we define \(u=\vec{y}^2\) and can
            then use \(\vec{y}\) as input coordinates for the boundary. In the case, however, that when scaling the
            points with \(u\neq 0\), we can instead scale \(u=1\) and use \(\vec{\tilde{y}}\) as input coordinatesfor
            the boundary. This gives us \(v=\vec{\tilde{y}}^2\), from which we can draw the following connection between
            the two sets:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\(\vec{\tilde{y}}=\frac{\vec{y}}{y^2}\)
          </p>

          <p>
            Note, that the above conditions allow only one of the two set may be used, dependent on if \(v=0\) or
            \(u=0\). Such that when \(v=0\) then \(\vec{\tilde{y}}=\vec{0}\), where as when \(u=0\) then
            \(\vec{y}=\vec{0}\). In these equations regarding the manifold boundary of \(AdS_{n+1}\) space, the one
            point \(v=0\) is the point at infinity for the coordinates \(\vec{y}\) and similiarily for the point
            \(u=0\). Thus, the boundary for the space is automatically compactified with the application of the given
            walk through.

            Using the square-integrable solution above, we can validate the given property of \(AdS_{d+1}\) is preserved
            and that \(d\phi=0\) and therefore \(\phi=0\). The reason this validates the property of a unique extension,
            is that we can see if we integrate the naive Laplace equation by parts respective to the square-intergrable
            solution, there does not exist a nonzero solution. This validation is important, because if a nonzero
            solution did exist, it would imply that any given solution works. Which tells us there is not an unique
            extenion and, therefore, in the space we can not properly calculate field equations. Since we see that for
            \(AdS_{d+1}\) space, there does exist an unique extension from \(\phi\) to \(\bar{B}_{d+1}\) for any
            function \(\phi(\Omega)\) on the boundary \(\mathbf{S}^d\), we can continue with calculating the massless
            field equation in good conscious.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, let's implement the Laplace equation with respect to \(B_{d+1}\) which can be written as:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\(\left(-\frac{1}{(\sinh y)^d} \frac{d}{d y}(\sinh y)^d \frac{d}{d y}+\frac{L^2}{\sinh ^2
            y}\right)\)\(\phi=0\)
          </p>

          <p>
            where the angular momentum squared \(L^{2}\) represents the angular of the Laplacian. If we then set the
            value for the scalar field \(\phi=\sum_\alpha \phi_\alpha(y)\), where \(f_\alpha\) are spherical harmonics,
            the equation for any \(\phi_{\alpha}\) on any large \(y\) is denoted as:
          </p>

          <p class="math-def">
						\(\frac{d}{d y} e^{d y} \frac{d}{d y} \phi_\alpha=0\)
          </p>

          <p>
            We can see that two solutions for the Laplace equations are \(\phi_\alpha \sim 1\) and \(\phi_\alpha
            \sim e^{-d y}\). Therefore, yay! We captured two solutions. These two solutions tell us that for every
            partial wave, we get a unique solution for the Lapalace equation with a given infinite value for the
            constant.

              The equations of motion for an Einstein frame are given below and note we will write \(a\) for \(a_{n}\):
            </p>

            <p class="math-def">
						\(R^\mu{ }_\nu = \frac{1}{2} \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi+\frac{1}{2 n !} e^{a
              \phi} \)
              \( \Big(n F^{\mu \xi_2 \ldots \xi_n} F_{\nu \xi_2 \ldots \xi_n} \)
              \( -\frac{n-1}{D-2} \delta_\nu^\mu F_n^2\Big) \)
              <br>
              \(\begin{aligned} \nabla^2 \phi & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \partial_\mu\left(\sqrt{g} \partial_\nu \phi g^{\mu
              \nu}\right) \\
              & = \frac{a}{2 n !} F_n^2 \\
              0 & = \partial_\mu\left(\sqrt{g} e^{a \phi} F^{\mu \nu_2 \ldots \nu_n}\right) \end{aligned}\)
            </p>

            <p>
              Where the \(n\)-form field strength \(F_{n}\neq 0\) for only one value of \(n\) and \(R^\mu{ }_\nu\) is
              the Ricci tensor.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, we will briefly examine Einstein's equations as they relate to asymptotically flat spacetimes and
              asymptotic symmetries, the use to construct such spacetimes is that the cosmological constant is zero and
              matter sources are localized. Here, we will look at solutions to Einstein's equation:
            </p>

            <p class="math-def">
						\(R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R=8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}\)
            </p>

            <p>
              An important property of Einstein's equation that relates to asmptotically flat spacetime is that, for the
              equation, as one moves far away, the matter stress tensor approaches zero and the metric in the asympotic
              region begins to approach that of flat spacetime. To continue, for the coordinate-based reprentation we
              will write down an expansion of the metric in powers of a radial coordinate, such that for a class of
              diffeomorphisms, it will preserve the falloffs to identify the asymptotic symmetry group. This region of
              expansion exists around a region of spacetime called the 'radiation zone', which is yielded by null
              geodesics at infinite affine parameter.
            </p>

            <p>
              To continue.

        <p>
          Given \(AdS_{n+1}\) space of constant negative curvature, a Hyperboloid in \((n+2)\)-dimensional flat
          spacetime with coordinates
          \((X^0, X^1, \ldots,\) \( X^n, X^{n+1})\) and metric \(\eta_{a b=}\) \(\operatorname{diag}(+,-,-,\ldots,\)
          \(-,+)\), we get the constant:

        <p class="math-def">
						\(\Lambda^2=\) \((X_0)_2+(X_{n+1})^2-\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i)^2\)
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, we introduce global coordinates in \(AdS\) \(\rho, \tau, \Omega_i\). Let \(X_0=\) \(\Lambda \sec \rho
          \cos \tau\), \(X_i=\) \(\Lambda \tan \rho\;\Omega_i\), and \(X_{n+1}=\) \(\Lambda \sec \rho \sin \tau\) where
          \(\sum_{i=1}^n \Omega_i^2=\) \(1,0 \leq \rho < \pi / 2,0 \) \(\leq \tau<2 \pi\). Note, since the time variable 
          is \(\tau\) is compact, we need an infinite set of copies of \(AdS\) space in the \(\tau\) direction to 
          unwrap it from the \(AdS\) covering space. </p>

            Anti-de Sitter/conformal theory correspondence AdS/CFT in theoretical physics is a conjecture that describes

          <p>
            Lorentzian \(n\)-space is the inner product space of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) vector space with \(n\)-dimensional
            Lorentzian inner product. Where the vector space is a set that is closed under finite vector addition and

          <p>
            The Minkowski Space is a particular type of Lorentzian space, specifically \(4\)-dimensional Lorentzian
            space,
            with a Minkowski metric or Minkowski tensor. Where the Minkowski metric is a
            type of metric tensor denoted as \(d
            \tau^2\) with the form \(-\left(d
            x^0\right)^2+\left(d x^1\right)^2+\left(d x^2\right)^2+\left(d x^3\right)^2\). Minkowski space forms the
            basis of the study of spacetime
            within special relativity. Another relative feature of this space is that it unifies \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\) plus
            time (the "fourth dimension") in Einstein's theory of special relativity.

          <p class="math-def">
						\(g_{\mu \nu} \approx \eta_{\mu \nu}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 &

          <p>
            Such that it is a metric of generally curved spacetime. One application of the Minkowski metric is modeling
            the cosmological constant term in Einstein's field equation with stress-energy from a vaccum or not.

        <div class="subsection-header-div">
          <p class="subsection-header" id="metric-signature">Metric Signature</p>
          <p>
            In theoretical physics, the metric signature counts the number of time-like or space-like characters are in
            the spacetime. For example, in the case Minkowski metric signature is \((1,3,0)^{+}\) or \((+,-,-,-)\) if
            the time direction is defined in the time direction. If the eigenvalue is defined in three spatial
            directions \(x,y,z\), then the metric signature is \((1,3,0)^{-}\) or \((-,+,+,+)\).
