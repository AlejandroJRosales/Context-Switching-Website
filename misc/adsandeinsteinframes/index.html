					The authors' goal is to understand better how the holographic principle extends from asymptotically <a class="sliding-link" href="#anti-de-sitter-spaces">AdS</a>
					spacetimes to asymptotically flat spacetimes. The authors mention this would provide a powerful toolkit to
					examine <a class="sliding-link" href="#gravitational-scattering">gravitational scattering</a>. Various

					at a holographic description include reconstructing bulk

          In this article we will first define and analyze underlying equations and terminology, so that we can better understand the authors' applications and intentions, and then analyze the prosed work and goal.

            Anti-de Sitter space AdS in theoretical physics is a conjecture used in theories of quantum gravity, where the theories are formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. To continue, we will examine the mathematical properties of AdS space and string theory, then look at their relation to solutions for the empty space Einstein Equation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Einstein-Hilbert action is defined as the following with a cosmological term:
          </p>
        
          <p>
            \(S=-s \frac{1}{16 \pi G_D} \int d^D x \sqrt{|g|}(R+\Lambda)\)
          </p>
        
          <p>
            We begin looking at the <a class="sliding-link" href="#minkowski-metric">Minkowski metric</a> where the Eucledian signature is "mostly plus" \(s=-1\) and will then consider the "mostly minus" metric \(s=+1\). The empty space Einstein Equation is: 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            \(\begin{aligned}
            R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R & =\frac{1}{2} \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} \Rightarrow \\
            R & =\frac{D}{2-D} \Lambda \Rightarrow \\
            R_{\mu \nu} & =\frac{\Lambda}{2-D} g_{\mu \nu}
            \end{aligned}\)
          </p>
  
          <p>
            where AdS and de Sitter space are solutions. A property of AdS and dS spaces that enable the solutions for Einstein Equations are that the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric tensor, meaning that AdS is itself an Einstein spacetime in the limit of zero mass/energy. Thus, since AdS has a Minkowski metric defined in it, the Minkowski metric is used in Einstein's original theories of relativity, special relativity, and other theories that incorporate special relativity!

            <p>
              We will look at how to obtain the Einstein frame \(S_{E}\) in \(10\)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter AdS spacetime. Let's look at applying the effective low-energy string action for type II (A or B) strings for the string
              frame \(S_{s}\):
            </p>
              
            <p>
              \(\begin{aligned} S_{s}= & -s \frac{1}{16 \pi G_{D}} \int d^{D} x \sqrt{|g|} \\ 
              & \left( e^{-2 \phi}\left(R+4 g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi\right) \right. \\
              & -\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \frac{1}{n !} F_n^2 +\ldots\big) \end{aligned}\)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              where the Newton constant is in \(D\)-dimensions. Here, the dots represent fermionic terms and the NS-NS 3-form field strength term, \(\phi\) is the dialation, and \(n\)-form field strengths \(F_{n}\) that are apart of the sector \(RR\). For the Newton constant in \(D\)-dimensions \(16 \pi G_D=2 \kappa_D^2\). Note, when the Minkowski Signature \(s=-1(+1)\) flips to the "mostly minus" signature an additional \((-)^{n}\) is introduced infront of \(F^{2}_{n}\).
            </p>
  
            <p>
              For IIA strings (IIB strings) only odd frames exist for \(n\). For Minkowski space, the IIB string, where \(n=5\), the field strength tensor is self-dual. Where a self-dual tensor satisfies \(*F=F\Rightarrow F=**F\). Next, adopting the action above, we can derive the <a class="sliding-link" href="#equations-of-motion">equations of motion</a> and imposing self-duality while ensuring that the normalization of \(F^{2}_{5}\) is unchanged. Note, it is convient to represent the actions for fields in the Einstein frame by first rescaling the strings using a specific type of Wely rescaling.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, we must validate it is suffcient to adopt the effective low energy action for type II strings in order to derive the equations of motions and imposing self-duality for \(D\)-spacetime dimensions. We validate the use of low energy action for type II strings by giving the implication:
            </p>

            <p>
              \(\begin{aligned} g_{\mu \nu} & \rightarrow e^{2\ \sigma \phi}\Rightarrow \\
              \sqrt{|g|} e^{-2 \phi} R & \rightarrow\end{aligned}\)
              <br>
              \(\begin{aligned} & \sqrt{|g|} e^{-\phi(\sigma(D-2)+2)} \left\{ R+2 \sigma(D-1)\right. \\
              & \frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}} \partial_\mu\big(\sqrt{|g|} \partial^{\mu} \phi\big) -\sigma^{2} (D-1) \\
              & \left. (D-2)(\partial \phi)^{2} \right\} \end{aligned}\)
            </p>

            <p>
              Through this implication, we can verify it is suffcient to adopt the string action to derive the equations of motions and imposing self-duality. Thus, we can now continue.
            </p>
              
            <p>
              We will choose \(\sigma=-\frac{2}{D-2}\). By choosing this value for \(\sigma\) we can remove a total derivative when applied in \(10\)-dimensions we get:
            </p>

            <p>
              \(g_{\mu \nu}(\text { Einstein })=e^{-\frac{1}{2} \phi} g_{\mu \nu}(\text { string })\)
            </p>

            <p>
              Here, we show that result for a string action is equivalent to result of the Einstein-Hilbert action in AdS spacetime. It has been calculated that \(10\)-dimensional spacetime works best to obtain our Einstein frame:
            </p>

            <p>
              \(\begin{aligned} S_{E}= & -s \frac{1}{16 \pi G_{10}} \int d^{10} x \sqrt{|g|} \\ 
              & \left( R-\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi\right. \\
              & \left.-\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \frac{1}{n !} e^{a_{n}\phi} F_n^2+\ldots\right) \end{aligned}\)
            </p>

            <p>
              where \(a_n=-\frac{1}{2}(n-5)\). From the equation, we can recognize the Minkowksi metric \(g_{\mu \nu}\) and the Minkowski Euclidean signature \(s=-1(+1)\) paired with the Newton constant in \(D\)-dimensions \(16 \pi G_D\). We also see the familiarity of this equation to the Einstein-Hilbert action, where, if you recall, the Einstein-Hilbert action is:
            </p>

            <p>
              \(S=-s \frac{1}{16 \pi G_D} \int d^D x \sqrt{|g|}(R+\Lambda)\)
            </p>
              
            <p>
              All-in-all, in this section we validated that adopting the low-energy string action for the Einstein-Hilbert action is sufficent for calcuating Einsteins equations of motions and imposing self-duality, specifically, in \(10\)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Therefore, congratulations! We have now derived an Einstein frame \(S_{E}\) in \(10\)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime implementing string theory!

              <p class="subsection-header" id="m-theory-11-dimensional-super-gravityin-einstein-frame">M-theory as 11-dimensional Super Gravity in the Einstein Frame</p>

              <p>
                We will look at low-energy M-theory in the form of \(11\)-dimensional super gravity, where the bosonic part of the action in the Einstein frame is:
              </p>

              <p>
                \(\begin{aligned} & S_{\text {bosonic }}(11 \text {-dim SUGRA })= \\ 
                & -s \frac{1}{2 \kappa_{11}^2} \left(\int d^{11} x \sqrt{|g|}\right. \\ 
                & \left\{R-\frac{1}{48} K^2\right\} \\ 
                & \left.-\frac{1}{6} \int C \wedge K \wedge K\right)\end{aligned}\)
              </p>

              <p>
                such that there is no dilation \(\phi\) like we saw with \(10\)-dimensional spacetime. The bosonic field is the metric with a \(3\)-form guage potential \(C\) with a \(4\)-frame field strength tensor. We can denote this bosonic field as: 
              </p>

              <p>
                \(K=dC\)
              </p>

              <p>
                Meaning that when moving from \(10\)-dimensional spacetime to \(11\)-dimensional spacetime, we switch from the fermionic field to the bosonic field.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note, that we can still provide classical based solutions of the above theories. An example of this application is by considering static solutions to flat translationally invariant <a class="sliding-link" href="#brane">\(p\)-branes</a>, isotropic in transverse directions. For these static solutions and to cover all cases for classical based solutions in \(11\)-dimensional supergravity, we can use the following generic action:
              </p>
            
              <p>
                \(\begin{aligned} S=& -s \frac{1}{2 \kappa_D^2} \int d^D x \sqrt{g} \\ 
                & \left\{R-\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi \right. \\ 
                & \left. -\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \frac{1}{n !} e^{a_n \phi} F_n^2+. .\right\} \end{aligned}\)
              </p>

              <p>
                where for 11-dimensional supergravity, \(a=0\) and \(\phi \equiv 0\).
              </p>

          The point of asymptotically flat spacetimes and asymptotic symmetries is to construct spacetimes such that the cosmological constant is zero and matter sources are localized. Here, we will look at solutions to Einstein's equation:
        </p>

        <p>
          \(R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R=8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}\)
        </p>

        <p>
          An important property of Einstein's equation that relates to asmptotically flat spacetime is that, for the equation, as one moves far away, the matter stress tensor approaches zero and the metric in the asympotic region begins to approach that of flat spacetime. To continue, for the coordinate-based reprentation we will write down an expansion of the metric in powers of a radial coordinate, such that for a class of diffeomorphisms, it will preserve the falloffs to identify the asymptotic symmetry group. This region of expansion exists around a region of spacetime called the 'radiation zone', which is yielded by null geodesics at infinite affine parameter.

					<p>
						Anti-de Sitter/conformal theory correspondence AdS/CFT in theoretical physics is a conjecture that describes
						the relationship between two kinds of physical theories. AdS used in quantum gravtiy and is formulated in
						terms of string theory of M-theory, while, CFT are quantum field theories that include theories such as
						Yang-Mills theories describing elementatry particles.

					<p>
						Lorentzian \(n\)-space is the inner product space of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) vector space with \(n\)-dimensional
						Lorentzian inner product. Where the vector space is a set that is closed under finite vector addition and
						scalar multiplication and inner product is defined as a vector space with an inner product on it.

					<p>
						The Minkowski Space is a particular type of Lorentzian space, specifically \(4\)-dimensional Lorentzian
						space,
						with a Minkowski metric or Minkowski tensor. Where the Minkowski metric is a
						type of metric tensor denoted as \(d
						\tau^2\) with the form \(-\left(d
						x^0\right)^2+\left(d x^1\right)^2+\left(d x^2\right)^2+\left(d x^3\right)^2\). Minkowski space forms the
						basis of the study of spacetime
						within special relativity. Another relative feature of this space is that it unifies \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\) plus
						time (the "fourth dimension") in Einstein's theory of special relativity.

          <p>
            The Minkowski metric is defined as:
          </p>

          <p>
            \(g_{\mu \nu} \approx \eta_{\mu \nu}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]\)
          </p>

          <p>
            Such that it is a metric of generally curved spacetime. One application of the Minkowski metric is modeling the cosmological constant term in Einstein’s field equation with stress-energy from a vaccum or not.
