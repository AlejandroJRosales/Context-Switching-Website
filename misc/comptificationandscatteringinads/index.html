				In theoretical physics, Minkowski Space is a particular type of \(4\)-dimensional Lorentzian space, with
				a Minkowski metric. Where the Minkowski metric is metric tensor denoted as \(d\tau^2\) with the form
				\(-\left(d^0\right)^2+\left(d x^1\right)^2\) \(+\;\left(d x^2\right)^2+\left(d x^3\right)^2\). Minkowski space
				forms the basis of the study of spacetime within special relativity and is the primary space we will use
				throughout.

					The authors' goal is to understand better how the holographic principle extends from asymptotically <a class="sliding-link" href="#anti-de-sitter-spaces">AdS</a>
					spacetimes to asymptotically flat spacetimes. The authors mention this would provide a powerful toolkit to
					examine <a class="sliding-link" href="#gravitational-scattering">gravitational scattering</a>. Various
					attempts
					at a holographic description include reconstructing bulk
					geometries from data at null infinity. The protocols for bulk geometries are usually extracting an
					\(S\)-matrix from the flat limit or by foliating <a class="sliding-link" href="#minkowski-space">Minkowski space</a> with hyperboloids. Where the latter's
					hyperboloids are on AdS/CFT dictionaries.
				</p>

        <p>
          In this article we will first define and analyze underlying equations and terminology, so that we can better understand the authors' applications and intentions, and then analyze the prosed work and goal.

        <p>
          The point of asymptotically flat spacetimes and asymptotic symmetries is to construct spacetimes such that the cosmological constant is zero and matter sources are localized. Here, we will look at solutions to Einstein's equation:
        </p>

        <p>
          \(R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R=8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}\)
        </p>

        <p>
          An important property of Einstein's equation that relates to asmptotically flat spacetime is that, for the equation, as one moves far away, the matter stress tensor approaches zero and the metric in the asympotic region begins to approach that of flat spacetime. To continue, for the coordinate-based reprentation we will write down an expansion of the metric in powers of a radial coordinate, such that for a class of diffeomorphisms, it will preserve the falloffs to identify the asymptotic symmetry group. This region of expansion exists around a region of spacetime called the 'radiation zone', which is yielded by null geodesics at infinite affine parameter. 
        </p>
      </div> -->
				<p>
					We first define a flat metric on Minkowski space, resembling the standard Minkowski metric, given in
					the spherical coordinates as:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(d s^2=-d t^2+d r^2+2 r^2 \gamma_{z \bar{z}} d z d \bar{z}\)
				</p>

				<p>
					Here, \(\gamma_{z \bar{z}}=\frac{2}{(1+z \bar{z})^2}\) is defined with polar coordinates \(z=e^{i
					\phi} \tan \frac{\theta}{2}\) and the spherical coordinates are projective coordinates for the
					\(S^{2}\) factor named the celestrial sphere \(CS^{2}\).
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, let \(u, v \in(-\infty, \infty)\), where the finite range \(U,V \in\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},
					\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) covers a given manifold. Next, we define new coordinates \((T,R)\), using the
					double null coordinates \((U,V)\) such that \(T=U+V\) and \(R=V-U\). The Minkowski metric \(ds^{2}\)
					relative to the coordinates \((T,R)\) is a conformal factor times the Lorentz metric on
					\(S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}\) and can be written as:
				</p>

				<p>
					\(\begin{aligned} ds^{2} = & \left(\frac{L^2}{4 \cos ^2\left(\frac{R-T}{2}\right) \cos
					^2\left(\frac{R+T}{2}\right)}\right) \\
					& -d T^2+d R^2+2 \sin ^2 R \gamma_{z \bar{z}} d z d \bar{z} \\
					= & \;\Omega^{-2} d \widetilde{s}^2 \end{aligned}\)
				</p>

				<p>
					Here, our conformal factor is denoted as \(\Omega^{-2}\) and, as we can see from above, is defined
					as:
				</p>

				<p style="font-size:120%">
					\(\Omega^{-2}=\frac{L^2}{4 \cos ^2\left(\frac{R-T}{2}\right) \cos ^2\left(\frac{R+T}{2}\right)}\)
				</p>

				<p>
					An important property of this conformal factor is that it is positive, thus, preserving the casual
					structure for the rescaled metric \(d \widetilde{s}^2\). This is important, because preserving the
					casual structures in this compactification allows for curves that begin as timelike, null, or
					spacelike, to maintain as such with respect to the rescaled metric.
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, we will attach a boundary to this compactification so that we can better understand the
					behavior of inifinity as it relates to Minkowski space and asymptotically flat spacetimes. These
					boundaries are given by the author, and are as folllows:
					<li>
						Massive particles following time-like trajectories will enter at past timelike infinity and will
						exit at future timelike infinity. Where past timelike infinity is denoted as \(i^{-}\) and
						paramterized by \((R,T)=(0,-\pi)\) and future timelike infinity is denoted as \(i^{+}\) and
						parameterized by \((R,T)=(0,\pi)\).
					</li>
					<li>
						Massless particles enter along past null-infinity and exit along future null-infinity. Where
						past null-inifinity is denoted as \(\mathcal{I}^{-}\) and paramterized by \(U=-\frac{\pi}{2}, V
						\in\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) and future null-infinity is denoted as
						\(\mathcal{I}^{+}\) and paramterized by \(V=\frac{\pi}{2}, U \in\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},
						\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\).
					</li>
					<li>
						Moving along any spacelike infinity, results in spacelike infinity. Where spacelike infinity is
						denoted as \(i^{0}\) and paramterized by \((R,T)=(\pi,0)\).
					</li>
					</ul>

						massive particles enter at \(i^{-}\) and exit at \(i^{+}\). Theoretically, many penrose-patches
						mathematically establish the space for white holes, parallel universes, antiverses, and
						Einstein-Rose bridges, however, I digress. I will probably learn and then write about this in
						the future though!
