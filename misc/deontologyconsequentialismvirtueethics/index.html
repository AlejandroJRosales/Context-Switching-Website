				<p>
					Virtue Ethics is a branch of one of three major approaches to <a class="sliding-link"
						href="#normative-ethics">normative ethics</a>, where normative
					ethics, at the risk of oversimplification, is concerned with criteria for what is right and
					wrong. The three main philosophical ideologies concerning normative ethics are the following. Virtue
					ethics, which can be identified from the other approaches to normative ethics, is that which
					emphasizes virtues or moral character. Whereas deontology, emphasizes
					duties or rules. Lastly, consequentialism, emphasizes the consequences of actions. We will examine the ethical perspectives, consequences, and implications for each of these notions of what is right and wrong. Let's begin.

						Hedonists count both pleasures and pains, where their ethical theory is that where satisfaction of
						desire is the highest good and proper aim of human life. A notable philosopher who espoused
						hedonistic notions on that which is right and wrong, was Epicurus, such that Epicurus' ethics is a form of egoistic hedonism. It is important we note, that
						pleasure is not the absence of pain
						because there are times when people experience neither pleasure nor pain and times when we feel
						both.
					</p>

					<p>
						We can read opposing view points of hedonism in classic utilitarianism from contemporaries such as Bentham and Mill. They argued that hedonism lowers the value of human life to the level of animals. Bentham stated that a simple game such as push-pin is renderd as equally valuable as something highly intellectual, such as poetry, if it produces an equal amount of pleasure. However, quantitative hedonists assert that poetry produced with significance can generate more pleasure than trivial games. This is due impart to the fact that the pleasures derived from poetry are certain (or probable), durable (or lasting), fecund (likely to lead to other pleasures), pure (unlikely to lead to pains), and so on. The simplicity of hedonism, thus, can be percieved as a source of opposition.
					</p>

					<p>
						Mill employed a different approach in order to avoid equating push-pin with poetry. Where he made a distinction between higher and lower qualities of pleasures based on the preferences of individuals who have encountered both types. This hedonistic notion is defined as qualitative hedonism and has also been a subject of much critism; as with any philsophy worth debating.
