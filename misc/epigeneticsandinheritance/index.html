                    In biology, epigenetics is the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene
                    function that cannot be explained by changes to the DNA sequence. Epigenetics normally involves
                    change that is not erased by cell division and that also affects the regulation of gene expression.
                    Epigenetics reflects our understanding that, despite the complement of DNA being fundamentally
                    identical in all somatic cells of an organism, patterns in gene expression can vary greatly among
                    different cell types. Additionally, these patterns have the potential for clonal inheritance.

                        Holliday, Pugh, and Riggs proposed the idea that DNA methylation was palindromic, acted as an
                        epigenetic mark, and that distinct enzymes were responsible for methylation of both modified
                        and unmodified DNA already methylnated on one strand. This idea was in response to Ohno et al.
                        1959; Lyon
                        1961, where X chromosome inactivation in mice was studied. A silenced X chromosome was randomly
                        selected and clonally inherited in somatic cells, even though no DNA sequence changes were
                        present. The second methylation was less likely to occur after the first DNA methylation.
                        However, the complementary strand would be modified at the same palindromic site shortly after.
                        This was a key insight, as it suggested that a DNA methylation mark on one strand would be
                        copied to the daughter strand after DNA replication, thus allowing for transmission of the
                        methylated state from one generation to the next.
