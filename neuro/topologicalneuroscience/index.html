				One main theoretical framework that is used to model, estimate, and simulate brain networks from complex network
				science is graph theory. A graph being a composition of a set of
				intereconnected elements know as vertices and edges. The vertices in a network can represent brain areas, while
				edges can represent the functional conncectivity between pais of vertices.
			</p>

			<p>
				Regarding imaging modalities to recontruct the brain network, the one we will focus on here is the resting-state
				functional MRI (rsfMRI). This imaging indirectly measures brain activity while a subject is at rest.

						<p>
							The vertex degree quantifies the total numbers of vertex connections that exist
							in an uniderected binary network. The vertex degree for an undirected weighted network, such as the
							rsfMRI,
							represents the sum of all edges of the vertex and is equivalent to its degree centraility. We can look at
							the vertex degree anaglously to the vertex strength and is useful to give an idea of how densely
							individual
							vertices are connected. It can be computed as follows:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(C_{D}=s_{i}=\sum_{j\neq i}^{}w_{ij}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Where \(w_{ij}\) is the respective weight of the edge that links vertex \(i\) and vertex \(j\).

						</p>

						<p>
							Where \(s_{i}\) is the degree of vertex \(i\) and the edge wegihts are normalised by the maximum weight in
							the network. We can represent this normilization as:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(\hat{w}_{ij}=\frac{w_{ij}}{max(w)}\)

						<p>
							In order to measure a vertex's importance in a netwrok and consider its neightbour's influence we
							ascertain
							its eigenvector centrality which is degree-based. This is so we can consider both the vertices quantity
							and
							quality its connections. We can compute the eigenvector centraility by computing the spectra of the
							adjacency matrix:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(Ax=\lambda x\)
						</p>

						<p>
							Where \(A\) represent the adjacency matrix and \(x\) is the eigenvector with a value of \(\lambda\) of
							\(A\).
						</p>

						<p>
							Given the previous, we can define the eigenvector conetrality of some vertex \(i\) as:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(C_{E}(i)=\frac{1}{\lambda_{1}}\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{ij}x_{j}\)

						The authors note that currently research in neuroscience focuses more on a
						microscopic view of neuronal architecture that is based on pairwise interactions. Thus, mesoscopic and
						macroscopic studies of the brain inherit this dyadic viewpoint. This reductionist perspective on complex
						systems, despite having enabled many breakthroughs in neuroscience, leaves an incomplete view. Such
						important neuroscientific observations like astrocytes regulate structural as well as synaptic plasticity.
						The authors cite that astrocytes regulate hetero-synaptic interactions as well as the heterogeneity of
						synaptic strength. These crucial regulatory astrocytes enable higher-order interactions, thus, forcing a
						shift in perspective of current neural interaction theories to incorporate higher-order structures.

					<p>Let's more cloesley examining why higher-order structures in brain networks is important for gaining a
						more
						informed neuroscientific understanding. The figure above illustrates the neccesity for the incorporation
						of
						such higher-order strcutures. This is because the illustration shows
						how interactions in higher-order complex systems, especially those in functional brain netwroks, are
						misrepresented as the approximations of the sum of pairwise interactions. However, the authors suggest,
						with
						a sutiable high-order connectivity rule, we can define higher-order hubs in a network, that will
						circumvent
						the combinitorial complexity assoicated with enumerating only the important high-order edges in known
						priority hyperedge networks.

						The <a class="sliding-link" href="#section-reference-1">authors'\(^{[1]}\)</a> methodology for representing
						statistical structures of time series as hypergraphs is implemented and outlined in five steps below and
						sketched out in the figure above:
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Let the input be an \(N\) time series. First, we must build the hypergraph. Assign one node per
								time series. For all corresponding time series in the rsfMRI, each node represent a different brain
								region.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Next, choose an order \(k\in \left\{3,...,N\right\}\). Then, between all possible different groups of
								\(k\)

								nodes with a high-order interdependency metric, calculate the \(\binom{N}{k}\) \(k\)-order associated
								terms. The reason hypergraphs are chosen to represent pairwise connectivity, is because different
								multivariate similarities can be measured and considered. The authors focus on two infomraiton-theortic
								measures: Interaction Information and Total Correlation.
							</p>

							<p>
								Interactive information quantifies a single tuple for statisical dependencies. Total Correlation
								quantifies the sum of all statisitcal dependencies over all tuple subsets.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								For hyperedge selection, the number of \(k\)-order iteractions in \(N\) nodes grows as \(N^{k}\). This
								graph representation would be a complete weighted graph. However, the authors mention strategies to
								acces the significant edges in the network.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
