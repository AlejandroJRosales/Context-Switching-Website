				One main theoretical framework that is used to model, estimate, and simulate brain networks from complex
				network science is graph theory. A graph being a composition of a set of intereconnected elements know as vertices and edges. The vertices in a network can represent brain areas, while edges can represent the functional conncectivity between pais of vertices. In order to recontruct the brain network imaging modalities used is mainly the resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). This imaging indirectly measures brain activity while a subject is at rest.

							The vertex degree quantifies the total numbers of vertex connections that exist
							in an uniderected binary network. The vertex degree for an undirected weighted network which represents the sum of all edges of the vertex and is equivalent to its degree centraility.
							We can look at the vertex degree anaglously to the vertex strength and is useful to give an idea of how
							densely individual vertices are connected. It is computed as:
						</p>

						<p>
							\(C_{D}=s_{i}=\sum_{j\neq i}^{}w_{ij}\)
						</p>

						<p>
							where \(w_{ij}\) is the respective weight of the edge that links vertex \(i\) and vertex

						<p>
							where \(s_{i}\) is the degree of vertex \(i\) and the edge wegihts are normalised by the

							and
							quality its connections. We can compute the eigenvector centraility by computing the spectra
							of the adjacency matrix \(Ax=\lambda x\). Where \(A\) represent the adjacency matrix and \(x\) is the eigenvector with a value of \(\lambda\) of \(A\). We can then define the eigenvector conetrality of some vertex \(i\) as:

						Currently, neuroscience research predominantly focuses on a microscopic examination of neuronal architecture rooted in pairwise interactions. Consequently, mesoscopic and macroscopic studies inherit this dyadic perspective, which potentially provides an incomplete understanding of complex systems. Important observations like the regulatory role of astrocytes in both structural and synaptic plasticity. The authors cite that astrocytes regulate hetero-synaptic interactions as well as the
						heterogeneity of
						synaptic strength. These crucial regulatory astrocytes enable higher-order interactions, thus,
						forcing a
						shift in perspective of current neural interaction theories to incorporate higher-order
						structures.

					<p>Let's more cloesley examining why higher-order structures in brain networks is important for
						gaining a
						more
						informed neuroscientific understanding. The figure above illustrates the neccesity for the
						incorporation
						of
						such higher-order strcutures. This is because the illustration shows
						how interactions in higher-order complex systems, especially those in functional brain netwroks,
						are
						misrepresented as the approximations of the sum of pairwise interactions. However, the authors
						suggest,
						with
						a sutiable high-order connectivity rule, we can define higher-order hubs in a network, that will
						circumvent
						the combinitorial complexity assoicated with enumerating only the important high-order edges in
						known
						priority hyperedge networks.

						The <a class="sliding-link" href="#section-reference-1">authors'\(^{[1]}\)</a> methodology for
						representing
						statistical structures of time series as hypergraphs is implemented and outlined in five steps
						below and
						sketched out in the figure above:
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Let the input be an \(N\) time series. First, we must build the hypergraph. Assign one
								node per
								time series. For all corresponding time series in the rsfMRI, each node represent a
								different brain
								region.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Next, choose an order \(k\in \left\{3,...,N\right\}\). Then, between all possible
								different groups of
								\(k\)

								nodes with a high-order interdependency metric, calculate the \(\binom{N}{k}\)
								\(k\)-order associated
								terms. The reason hypergraphs are chosen to represent pairwise connectivity, is because
								different
								multivariate similarities can be measured and considered. The authors focus on two
								infomraiton-theortic
								measures: Interaction Information and Total Correlation.
							</p>

							<p>
								Interactive information quantifies a single tuple for statisical dependencies. Total
								Correlation
								quantifies the sum of all statisitcal dependencies over all tuple subsets.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								For hyperedge selection, the number of \(k\)-order iteractions in \(N\) nodes grows as
								\(N^{k}\). This
								graph representation would be a complete weighted graph. However, the authors mention
								strategies to
								acces the significant edges in the network.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

						To continue.
