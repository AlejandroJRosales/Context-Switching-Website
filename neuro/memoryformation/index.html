						In long-term memory consolidation stress hormones, such as glucocorticoids, affect
						glucocorticoid receptors
						GR
						in pre- and post-synaptic neurons. These neurons mediate the brains ability to form long-term
						memories.
					</p>

					<p>
						GRs mediate several intracellular signaling pathways required for memory consolidation.
						Or simply put, long-term memory consolidation can be affected because GRs cause a domino like
						affect that
						occurs in the
						neurons. The GR mediated intracellular signaling pathways, or the "domino like" affect, is as
						follows.
					</p>

					<p>
						Activated GRs may influence the traffick of TrkB to the membrane surface and/or
						BDNF release.
						The binding of BDNF binding to its receptor TrkB leads to its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation
						results in
						the activation
						of ERK1/2, Akt and PLCγ. Activated GRs affect this and at the same time affect
						transcription-dependent
						mechanisms. This parrelel activation rapidly
						leads to CaMKIIα
						phosphorylation, similarily to the afforementiond activation of GRs.
						The activation of ERK1/2, Akt, PLCγ, and CaMKIIα pathways independently or can
						converge
						in CREB phosphorylation. CREB phosphorylation then leads to the synthesis of BDNF. The newly
						synthesized
						BDNF sustains the
						activation
						of the pathways and results in persistent phosphorylation of CREB, CaMKIIα. The end of this side
						of the
						domino
						effect leads to the downstream pre-synaptic target of
						CaMKIIα, phosopho-synapsin-1. So, GR activation recruits pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms to
						mediate
						memory consolidation.

					Memory consolidation was thought of as a unitary process that transformed a fragile memory trace
					into a stable
					one. However, in research done in the 1960s and in the last 15 years have shown otherwise. Memories
					that
					have become insensitive to disruption from specific types of interference have been show that
					they can become transiently labile when those memories are recalled. This recalled memory must again
					become
					stable,
					which is termed memory reconsolidation. We will further examine and look at the answer provide by
					the authors
					with respect to memory reconsolidation.
				</p>

				<p>
					An important question that naturally arises is what function does memory reconsolidation serve?
					There are
					two main hypothese proposed, the first being that reconsolidation serves to strengthen memories. The
					reasoning
					is
					that the phase of temporary fragility of the memory mediates additional consolidation, thus,
					producing a
					stronger
					and longer lasting memory. The second hypothesis postulates that the function of the post-retrieval
					process
					allows for the association of new information into the memories of past events. The purpose of this
					being the
					intergration of new learning with already establised and reactivated memories. More succenctly, the
					former
					hypothesis posits the function of memory reconsolidation is to strengthen memorires, while the
					ladder suggests
					reconsolidation is for memory updating.
				</p>

				<p>
					The findings of the researchers in the paper are that reconsolidation strengthens memories and does
					not
					mediate in memory updating.
